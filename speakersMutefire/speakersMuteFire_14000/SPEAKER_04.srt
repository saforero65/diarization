17
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,537
SPEAKER_04: <i>The newspaper "Correo Nacional",</i>

18
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:54,806
SPEAKER_04: <i>published in Bogotá on March 6th, 1906,</i>

19
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,111
SPEAKER_04: <i>the exact and vivid account</i>
of the execution of four men

20
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,282
SPEAKER_04: <i>for the attempt of murder of</i>
the General Rafael Reyes,

21
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,683
SPEAKER_04: <i>by that time president</i>
of Colombia.

22
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:16,763
SPEAKER_04: <i>Marco Arturo Salgar, Carlos Roberto Gonzalez,</i>
Juan Ortiz and Fernando Aguilar.

23
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:21,033
SPEAKER_04: <i>were the four men sentenced</i>
to death, and in consequence

24
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:25,305
SPEAKER_04: <i>shot in the same place where</i>
they committed the crime.

25
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:30,776
SPEAKER_04: <i>The account, whose author's</i>
name remains unknown,

26
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:32,679
SPEAKER_04: <i>is extremely detailed.</i>

27
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:38,418
SPEAKER_04: <i>For example, he describes one by one the kind</i>
of hat that each condemned was wearing.

28
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,587
SPEAKER_04: <i>It’s worth quoting the whole fragment:</i>

29
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:46,491
SPEAKER_04: <i>"They were all wearing black:</i>
Salgar wore a straight wing cinnamon hat.

30
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,262
SPEAKER_04: <i>Aguilar wore a Panama hat.</i>

31
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,331
SPEAKER_04: <i>Gonzales, a black Tyrolean hat.</i>

32
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:55,235
SPEAKER_04: <i>And Ortiz wore a black hard hat."</i>

33
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,838
SPEAKER_04: <i>The reporter also collects</i>
a series of interviews.

34
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:06,145
SPEAKER_04: <i>The most striking is perhaps, the one from</i>
the Captain of Executions, who just says,

35
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,983
SPEAKER_04: <i>in a serious tone I'd guess:</i>
"Nothing is sacred".

36
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:18,190
SPEAKER_04: <i>The reporter states: "The shooting</i>
proceeds as normal.

37
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:21,694
SPEAKER_04: <i>Given the signal with his sword</i>
by the Captain of Executions,

38
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,630
SPEAKER_04: <i>the first round of shooting</i>
resounds from the rifles.

39
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,470
SPEAKER_04: <i>Afterwards, a group of doctors approaches</i>

40
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,305
SPEAKER_04: <i>and certify that the condemned</i>
are still breathing,

41
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,774
SPEAKER_04: <i>and give the order for</i>
a second shooting,

42
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,110
SPEAKER_04: <i>which ends with the immediate</i>
entrance of the four coffins

43
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,680
SPEAKER_04: <i>to transport the corpses</i>
to the cemetery."

44
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,494
SPEAKER_04: <i>This time, the event is more relevant than</i>
usually, since president Rafael Reyes

45
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:58,298
SPEAKER_04: <i>guided by this moment of political</i>
instability, makes an exception

46
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,701
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the shooting doesn't take place in</i>
the courtyard of the School of Infantry,

47
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,771
SPEAKER_04: <i>where it would normally happened.</i>

48
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:08,675
SPEAKER_04: <i>Instead, it's held in a public area,</i>
in front of over 10,000 people.

49
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:21,053
SPEAKER_04: <i>Rafael Reyes saw here the</i>
remains of the last civil war

50
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:25,358
SPEAKER_04: <i>that had ended only four years ago,</i>
and still had the country in agony.

51
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:30,295
SPEAKER_04: <i>Shooting people of his same</i>
political party in public areas,

52
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,165
SPEAKER_04: <i>was for him a sign of authority,</i>

53
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:35,767
SPEAKER_04: <i>but also an invitation to end</i>
the traditional divide

54
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:38,937
SPEAKER_04: <i>between the liberal</i>
and the conservative party.

55
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,511
SPEAKER_04: <i>With the purpose of making this shooting</i>
visible to as many people as possible

56
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:51,550
SPEAKER_04: <i>Reyes publishes the book "February 10th",</i>
telling the events through photos.

57
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:56,389
SPEAKER_04: <i>Reyes thought that, just like the people</i>
who witnessed the shooting in person did,

58
00:05:56,588 --> 00:06:01,728
SPEAKER_04: <i>everyone who saw those photos</i>
would immediately support his idea.

59
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,367
SPEAKER_04: <i>Nevertheless, the most interesting</i>
part of this series of photos

60
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,372
SPEAKER_04: <i>happens after the moment</i>
of the cemetery picture.

61
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:22,048
SPEAKER_04: <i>It’s unknown whose idea it was, but due to the</i>
impact caused by the pictures of the execution

62
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,053
SPEAKER_04: <i>president Rafael Reyes, Chief of police</i>
Pedro Pedraza, and photographer Lino Lara

63
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:32,290
SPEAKER_04: <i>decided together to recreate</i>
the moments before the shooting.

64
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,394
SPEAKER_04: <i>They decided to recreate</i>
the attack on the president

65
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,798
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the capture of the condemned,</i>
to create a story.

66
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,858
SPEAKER_04: <i>The outcome was what the historians</i>
called a "false document".

67
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:12,899
SPEAKER_04: <i>From the 22 pictures that make up</i>
the story, 18 are theatrical reenactments.

68
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:19,639
SPEAKER_04: <i>This is the first time of a tale made</i>
through photographs in Colombia.

69
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:23,074
SPEAKER_04: <i>This little narrative gesture,</i>
is acknowledged by tradition

70
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,377
SPEAKER_04: <i>as the beginning of</i>
filmmaking in the country.

71
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,531
SPEAKER_04: <i>Here lays the body of Rafael Reyes today.</i>

72
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,406
SPEAKER_04: <i>This was going to be a movie about the</i>
beginnings of Cinema in Colombia,

73
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,141
SPEAKER_04: <i>about its first images.</i>

74
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,911
SPEAKER_04: <i>But as it's being said:</i>

75
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,580
SPEAKER_04: <i>To talk about Colombia</i>
we have to talk about war.

76
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:39,251
SPEAKER_04: <i>And to talk about war we need to talk about</i>
armies, about deaths, about cemeteries.

77
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:44,823
SPEAKER_04: <i>At the same time, my house and my</i>
parents house looked like a cemetery.

78
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,296
SPEAKER_04: <i>It felt like haunted by an inert current,</i>
like flooded by murky water

79
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,899
SPEAKER_04: <i>or better, by dead water.</i>

80
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:58,303
SPEAKER_04: <i>A few months ago my mother</i>
had an episode of mutism,

81
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:01,173
SPEAKER_04: <i>and without any explanation,</i>
she just stopped talking.

82
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,243
SPEAKER_04: <i>I remember with some nostalgia</i>

83
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:08,880
SPEAKER_04: <i>how she repeated the words of that</i>
Mexican musician while cooking:

84
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:12,485
SPEAKER_04: <i>that said something like:</i>
"I wish you to be happy, very happy...

85
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,921
SPEAKER_04: <i>I wish you to find love,</i>
because you deserve it"

86
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:20,058
SPEAKER_04: <i>I read somewhere that the first thing you</i>
forget about a person is the voice.

87
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,099
SPEAKER_04: <i>Affected by this</i>
familiar incident,

88
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,168
SPEAKER_04: <i>and because of what connects</i>
all things together

89
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:33,072
SPEAKER_04: <i>maybe the first moments</i>
of national cinema

90
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,308
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the muteness of my mother can</i>
be part of the same scenario.

91
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,211
SPEAKER_04: <i>Like when you look at a surface</i>
where shadows are being projected

92
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,149
SPEAKER_04: <i>and you can't tell each</i>
object from the other apart.

93
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,110
SPEAKER_04: <i>One night my father woke up and saw</i>
the light of the bathroom on.

94
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,980
SPEAKER_04: <i>When he came closer, he saw my mother in</i>
front of the mirror, shaking.

95
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,783
SPEAKER_04: <i>My father hugged her and</i>
asked her what was going on,

96
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,519
SPEAKER_04: <i>he asked her if she</i>
had a bad dream

97
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,354
SPEAKER_04: <i>but she couldn’t answer.</i>

98
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,456
SPEAKER_04: <i>Since that moment,</i>
she has never spoken again.

99
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:17,643
SPEAKER_04: <i>My mother spent most of the time locked in a</i>
room looking at people through the window.

100
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:40,566
SPEAKER_04: <i>Her presence had become more and</i>
more unbearable for my father

101
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:45,571
SPEAKER_04: <i>who couldn’t avoid feeling sometimes</i>
guilty, and sometimes cheated.

102
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,075
SPEAKER_04: <i>The ambiguity of the doctors answers</i>
left a bad feeling behind

103
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,077
SPEAKER_04: <i>which made him think</i>
that she was just pretending.

104
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,224
SPEAKER_04: <i>One day, a worker of the family suggested</i>
to try with another type of specialist

105
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:10,395
SPEAKER_04: <i>from his point of view, my mother's</i>
muteness was due to a powerful spell.

106
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:18,336
SPEAKER_04: <i>My father agreed, even if it</i>
would make him feel humiliated

107
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,539
SPEAKER_04: <i>because for him, superstitions</i>
were for fools.

108
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:26,111
SPEAKER_04: <i>After two weeks some kind of chaman</i>
or warlock came to my mother.

109
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:31,917
SPEAKER_04: <i>After wandering around the house, where some</i>
kind of weird mantle could certainly be felt

110
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:36,355
SPEAKER_04: <i>like a thick, rancid</i>
smell, he told my father:

111
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,058
SPEAKER_04: <i>"Your problems have a</i>
solution, don’t worry.

112
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,861
SPEAKER_04: <i>You just have to</i>
sell this house,

113

SPEAKER_04: <i>and leave somewhere visible a valuable</i>
object and a picture of her."

114
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,004
SPEAKER_04: <i>My father did so.</i>

115
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:57,243
SPEAKER_04: <i>The house was put on sale, and on a</i>
shelf he left a picture of her

116
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:01,312
SPEAKER_04: <i>and a black stone that she</i>
held like a luck charm.

117
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,418
SPEAKER_04: Please, put your legs up.

141
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,270
SPEAKER_04: <i>There’s an announcement on</i>
the internet that says:

SPEAKER_04: <i>That same afternoon, in a country</i>
house on the outskirts of the city,

147
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:19,964
SPEAKER_04: <i>I got to meet Carlos Pelbet,</i>

148
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:23,501
SPEAKER_04: <i>founder of an old audiovisual company</i>
that he and his brother had

149
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,770
SPEAKER_04: <i>since the beginning of the 80s.</i>

150
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,913
SPEAKER_04: <i>Carlos told me rapidly about</i>
his interest in films

151
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,951
SPEAKER_04: <i>or rather, he told me that at some</i>
point of his life it was of his interest.

152
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,452
SPEAKER_04: <i>Also that Pelbet, his company,</i>

153
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:45,557
SPEAKER_04: <i>inaugurated the recording and broadcasting</i>
business of soccer matches in Colombia

154
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:50,695
SPEAKER_04: <i>and that it was right then, when competing with</i>
the big TV channels, that the company broke.

155
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:54,732
SPEAKER_04: <i>He told me that a few years ago he started </i>
collecting anonymous family home movies

156
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:59,637
SPEAKER_04: <i>from the cassettes that he digitizes.</i>
Hours and hours of family events

157
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:05,277
SPEAKER_04: <i>weddings, first communions, birthdays,</i>
baptisms, Christmas and holidays.

158
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,263
SPEAKER_04: <i>In a sense, my film is</i>
a relative of all these images,

159
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,467
SPEAKER_04: <i>of the personal images of everyday rites.</i>

160
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,537
SPEAKER_04: <i>Carlos tells me that each week, a</i>
different youngster arrives at his door

161
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,940
SPEAKER_04: <i>wanting to digitize</i>
images of his family

162
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,842
SPEAKER_04: <i>with an idea similar to mine:</i>

163
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,278
SPEAKER_04: <i>To make a film about their mothers,</i>
fathers or grandparents.

164
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:25,049
SPEAKER_04: <i>Apparently more people are doing the</i>
same film as me at this moment.

SPEAKER_04: <i>We are all thinking about the same images.</i>

166
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,378
SPEAKER_04: <i>These are some images taken by my mother.</i>

167
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:59,084
SPEAKER_04: <i>A movie about a play in</i>
a rural school she worked at.

SPEAKER_04: <i>That’s me.</i>

170
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,813
SPEAKER_04: <i>In one of the movie cans,</i>
it was written on a white tape:

171
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:04,482
SPEAKER_04: <i>"Marquetalia, 1964".</i>

172
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:09,587
SPEAKER_04: <i>Those are the place and the date</i>
where the famous FARC was founded.

173
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:15,026
SPEAKER_04: <i>Apparently, the play is about a popular</i>
narration about the first combats

174
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,130
SPEAKER_04: <i>between the FARC guerilla </i>
and the National Army.

175
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,232
SPEAKER_04: <i>The story is the following:</i>

176
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,978
SPEAKER_04: <i>Having the intention of avoiding the</i>
expansion of the communist guerrilla,

177
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,449
SPEAKER_04: <i>on May 18th, 1964 president</i>
Guillermo León Valencia

178
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:40,618
SPEAKER_04: <i>sends over a thousand soldiers</i>
to the Tolima plateau

179
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:45,790
SPEAKER_04: <i>in search for a suspected FARC camp with</i>
48 members of the insurgent movement in it.

180
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:51,829
SPEAKER_04: <i>After nine days of intense</i>
wandering, the group of soldiers,

181
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,965
SPEAKER_04: <i>lead by Lieutenant Colonel</i>
José Joaquín Matallana,

182
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:59,171
SPEAKER_04: <i>starts suspecting that they’re wrong, </i>
that there’s no such camp.

183
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,476
SPEAKER_04: <i>They quickly realize that the insurgents</i>
are not full time soldiers,

184
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,478
SPEAKER_04: <i>and that most of them actually</i>

185
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,382
SPEAKER_04: <i>have a disguised life as farmers </i>
among the civilians.

186
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,252
SPEAKER_04: <i>A question immediately arose:</i>

187
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:20,224
SPEAKER_04: <i>How to tell the population, most of them</i>
farmers, from the guerrillas apart?

188
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,529
SPEAKER_04: <i>Facing this, Colonel</i>
José Joaquín Matallana,

189
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,567
SPEAKER_04: <i>who considered himself as an</i>
analytic and methodic person

190
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,970
SPEAKER_04: <i>and an innovating strategist,</i>
thought to have the answer.

191
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:37,209
SPEAKER_04: <i>He explains to his soldiers: "This problem</i>
is essentially about appearances".

192
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:42,113
SPEAKER_04: <i>Matallana ordered his soldiers to go</i>
after every man and woman of the area

193
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,983
SPEAKER_04: <i>and force them to wear the</i>
guerrilla uniform in front of them.

194
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:50,255
SPEAKER_04: <i>Matallana assured his soldiers,</i>

195
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:53,592
SPEAKER_04: <i>that the uniform had the</i>
strength and essential capacity

196
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,626
SPEAKER_04: <i>to reveal someone's identity.</i>

197
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,730
SPEAKER_04: <i>According to his logic,</i>
wearing the uniform

198
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:03,367
SPEAKER_04: <i>would immediately reveal if the person </i>
was a real guerilla soldier or not.

199
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:33,064
SPEAKER_04: <i>After two weeks they had captured 52 people,</i>
including five children and eight elderly.

200
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,067
SPEAKER_04: <i>This idea would be known later</i>
as the Matallana logic.

201
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,804
SPEAKER_04: <i>And what could have been a</i>
brilliant military operation,

202
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:42,673
SPEAKER_04: <i>ended up being one of the biggest</i>
political failures in history

203
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:47,913
SPEAKER_04: <i>because, in less than two years, those 48</i>
soldiers would later turn into five thousand.

204
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:56,020
SPEAKER_04: <i>From then on, the idea of the disguised</i>
guerrilla would become an obsession

205
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,557
SPEAKER_04: <i>in the development of</i>
public opinion in the country.

206
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,160
SPEAKER_04: <i>Throughout the years, the question</i>
would be incessantly repeated:

207
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,029
SPEAKER_04: <i>Who’s really from the guerilla, </i>
and who’s not?

208
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,958
SPEAKER_04: <i>More than 20 years ago</i>
my mother filmed me.

209

SPEAKER_04: <i>Today, I’m filming her.</i>

210

SPEAKER_04: <i>captured by the army and forced </i>
to dress like a guerilla man

212
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:55,547
SPEAKER_04: <i>I couldn’t avoid thinking of the</i>
recent events of the war in Colombia.

213
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:11,296
SPEAKER_04: <i>Thousands of innocent young people were </i>
captured by the National Army of Colombia

214
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:16,233
SPEAKER_04: <i>and taken to different parts </i>
of the country to be murdered later.

215
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,203
SPEAKER_04: <i>Then, their bodies were</i>
dressed up like guerilla-soldier

216
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,973
SPEAKER_04: <i>and presented in front of the</i>
media like military successes.

217
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:26,744
SPEAKER_04: <i>It was a systematic</i>
falsification of war events.

218
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,714
SPEAKER_04: <i>Stagings, using real victims</i>
to create a story.

219
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:42,727
SPEAKER_04: <i>By the year 2008, this practice</i>
was so common in the National Army

220
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:46,964
SPEAKER_04: <i>that the victims of this type of</i>
crime counted to the present day

SPEAKER_04: <i>the screening of this movie</i>

237
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:52,523
SPEAKER_04: <i>generated an unexpected anguish</i>

238
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:56,394
SPEAKER_04: <i>Apparently, proving the</i>
existence of revolutionary life

SPEAKER_04: <i>For the young Parisians of that time</i>

241

243
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:11,009

306
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,208
SPEAKER_04: <i>which due to the characteristics</i>
of its geography

307
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:15,311
SPEAKER_04: <i>suffered from a great lack of</i>
communication among its regions

308
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:20,518
SPEAKER_04: <i>which by the time was already producing great</i>
losses in large portions of the territory.

309
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:26,791
SPEAKER_04: <i>Rafael Reyes was looking for something a</i>
little more elusive and much more dangerous.

310
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,730
SPEAKER_04: <i>He was sure that all people of the</i>
country should be united by something,

311
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,434
SPEAKER_04: <i>a supposed "national essence" that </i>
would prevent their dismemberment.

312
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,869
SPEAKER_04: <i>He asked himself: What are we?</i>

313
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,905
SPEAKER_04: <i>The result of a discrete genocide?</i>

314
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,240
SPEAKER_04: <i>Or are we the occasional guardians</i>
of infinite clusters of gold

315
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:47,677
SPEAKER_04: <i>and immense expanses of water</i>
that turn into fruits?

316
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,353
SPEAKER_04: <i>Driven by the scientific spirit of the time</i>

317
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,358
SPEAKER_04: <i>Reyes saw in the photographic device</i>
the best tool to look for that essence.

318
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:14,070
SPEAKER_04: <i>He thought: If photographs can capture,</i>
better than anything else in the world

319
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:19,076
SPEAKER_04: <i>the outstanding feature of the identity of</i>
a subject that is, of course, his face

320
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,445
SPEAKER_04: <i>why wouldn’t it be able,</i>
with enough effort,

321
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:25,682
SPEAKER_04: <i>to reveal the image of the true face</i>
of these lands and thus, its identity?

322
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:32,789
SPEAKER_04: <i>A group of the right images</i>
can unify the country.

323
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:04,855
SPEAKER_04: <i>Thus, Rafael Reyes begins like this</i>
with his obsession with portraits

324
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:10,793
SPEAKER_04: <i>which would result in the most significant</i>
image of the book and possibly of the time:

325
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,302
SPEAKER_04: <i>The portrait of cacique</i>
José Dolores and his wife

326
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,672
SPEAKER_04: <i>holding a portrait of former </i>
President Rafael Reyes.

327
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:26,510
SPEAKER_04: <i>It has been thought, quite often,</i>

328
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,913
SPEAKER_04: <i>that Reyes was saying only one</i>
thing with this photograph:

329
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,315
SPEAKER_04: <i>I am Colombia.</i>

330
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,179
SPEAKER_04: <i>The photographs of Rafael Reyes </i>
and Lino Lara

331
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:06,550
SPEAKER_04: <i>represented a technological</i>
innovation for the country.

332
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,152
SPEAKER_04: <i>From this moment on,</i>

333
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:12,755
SPEAKER_04: <i>the way in which the different events were</i>
narrated would be radically transformed.

334
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:18,329
SPEAKER_04: <i>They marked the beginning of an informative</i>
treatment based on the display of images.

335
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:49,259
SPEAKER_04: <i>For those who, like myself, have experienced the</i>
war in Colombia exclusively through images

336
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,663
SPEAKER_04: <i>those of television,</i>
magazines and newspapers;

337
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:56,000
SPEAKER_04: <i>the figure of Rafael Rayes</i>
asks us a question:

338
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:01,204
SPEAKER_04: <i>Is there any link between the production of</i>
images and the war events in the country?

339
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:15,318
SPEAKER_04: <i>Over the years, the question about who’s</i>
a guerilla combatant and who’s not,

340
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:17,121
SPEAKER_04: <i>suffers a transformation.</i>

341
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,557
SPEAKER_04: <i>It mutates, becoming the obsession</i>
for one specific image:

342
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,193
SPEAKER_04: <i>The image of the dead guerilla.</i>

343
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:29,599
SPEAKER_04: <i>The image of the insurgent murdered</i>
at hands of agents of the State

344

screens of the country.

345
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:35,806
SPEAKER_04: <i>In a short time, it manages to dominate</i>
the imagination of public opinion

346
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:39,242
SPEAKER_04: <i>and its production is furiously</i>
demanded from everywhere.

347
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:43,646
SPEAKER_04: <i>"¡More images!", says the</i>
redactor to the journalist,

SPEAKER_04: <i>the editor to the photographer,</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>bars, stores, churches, houses;</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>Then, the horror came.</i>

353
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:09,773
SPEAKER_04: <i>It was discovered that many of those bodies,</i>
and in consequence many of those images

354
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,309
SPEAKER_04: <i>didn’t belong to authentic guerilla-soldier.</i>

355
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,045
SPEAKER_04: <i>That the bodies were </i>
of young innocents disguised,

356
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,047
SPEAKER_04: <i>that everything was a staging</i>

357

SPEAKER_04: <i>and that the testimonies of the soldiers</i>
were also reproductions of other combats.

358
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:36,032
SPEAKER_04: <i>The response of the audience</i>
to that truth was apathy.

359

SPEAKER_04: <i>We all said: Those are the mothers of</i>
the youngsters called "false positives".

SPEAKER_04: <i>Nobody said: I’m the one</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>We just said:</i>

363

368

SPEAKER_04: <i>as if the war events in the country would</i>
have been replaced by some kind of parody

SPEAKER_04: <i>by an evil imitation created by war itself.</i>

370
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,882
SPEAKER_04: <i>As if after all these years, the war would</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>its own copies.</i>

372

SPEAKER_04: <i>In 1906, Rafael Reyes</i>
created a "false document"

SPEAKER_04: <i>After this fall</i>

America enters the field

SPEAKER_04: <i>After this event, Carlos Pelbet was harassed</i>
for several days by hundreds of fanatics

SPEAKER_04: <i>who wanted to obtain the</i>
recordings of the game,

523
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:39,528
SPEAKER_04: <i>with the intention of studying the</i>
images very carefully themselves

as many times as necessary

527
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:53,208
SPEAKER_04: <i>until it spoke for itself and said</i>
if the fault was simulated or real.

528
01:01:57,045 --> 01:02:01,083
SPEAKER_04: <i>It's impossible for Carlos Pelbet </i>

SPEAKER_04: - Was my exit okay?
- It was fine.

SPEAKER_04: <i>Cut.</i>

SPEAKER_04: - Do I have to clap again?
- <i>Yes, please.</i>

537
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:58,474
SPEAKER_04: - <i>Ready?</i>
- Yes.

538
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:03,411
SPEAKER_04: <i>When I started this movie, I was trying to</i>
find out if my mother was pretending or not.

SPEAKER_04: <i>If she had really turned mute,</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>Neither my father nor other relatives</i>

542
01:03:14,322 --> 01:03:16,893
SPEAKER_04: <i>But, in a similar way to</i>
what many experienced

543
01:03:16,925 --> 01:03:19,762
SPEAKER_04: <i>when analyzing the images of the national </i>
Football championship final game

SPEAKER_04: <i>and someone who</i>
pretends to suffer.

546
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:32,541
SPEAKER_04: <i>So, Carlos points out that</i>
it's useless to judge an image

547
01:03:32,574 --> 01:03:35,411
SPEAKER_04: <i>wanting to discern what's</i>
real in it and what’s not.

548
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:40,081
SPEAKER_04: <i>For him, images are jus not a good</i>
place to look for the truth.

549
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:45,554
SPEAKER_04: <i>Then, from the projects of</i>
Thomas Alva Edison, Rafael Reyes

550
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,625
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the recent images that</i>
dramatize deaths and violent events

551
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,893
SPEAKER_04: <i>perhaps it would be</i>
better to ask ourselves:

552
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,063
SPEAKER_04: <i>What effects do these</i>
images have on the living?

553
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:59,534
SPEAKER_04: <i>Do they have any participation</i>
in the events they represent?

554
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,211
SPEAKER_04: <i>For example these women.</i>

555
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:17,847
SPEAKER_04: <i>All three are actresses</i>

556

SPEAKER_04: <i>who pose as if they had lost</i>
a family member in the war

557
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,251
SPEAKER_04: <i>and were claiming for them.</i>

01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,494
SPEAKER_04: …or something like that.

565
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:31,853
SPEAKER_04: <i>In a similar way to what happened with</i>
the photographs of February 10th

566
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:35,623
SPEAKER_04: <i>what would be properly considered as</i>

the attempt and death of a political leader.

568
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:46,369
SPEAKER_04: <i>On October 15th, 1914, a few</i>

on the right side of his head.

571
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:56,846
SPEAKER_04: <i>The politician was immediately transferred</i>
to a house in the center of the city

572
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:59,648
SPEAKER_04: <i>where he agonized for </i>
14 hours and finally died.

573
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:08,456
SPEAKER_04: <i>It’s told that hundreds of his followers</i>
walked all the way back to the Capitol

574
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:10,760
SPEAKER_04: <i>and with a white handkerchief </i>
in their hands

575
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:13,461
SPEAKER_04: <i>tried to pick up of the ground</i>
the blood of the politician.

576
01:07:14,295 --> 01:07:18,233
SPEAKER_04: <i>That same afternoon, while</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>who later would be recognized as</i>
"the fathers of Colombian Cinema"

579

SPEAKER_04: <i>Only one shot from the</i>
film is preserved.

SPEAKER_04: <i>These images are from the same</i>
date but made with other cameras.

583
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:49,364
SPEAKER_04: <i>However, due to the great</i>
controversy caused by the film

can be found in newspapers of the time.

585
01:07:58,273 --> 01:08:01,911
SPEAKER_04: <i>For example, we know that the</i>
film started with a fade

586
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,246
SPEAKER_04: <i>that slowly showed a</i>
portrait of the soldier.

587
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:09,318
SPEAKER_04: <i>After almost a minute in which the</i>
image was still on the screen

588
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:14,657
SPEAKER_04: <i>followed a scene that recreated the last</i>
moments of agony and death of the politician.

SPEAKER_04: <i>We also know that the film</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>Despite the good intentions</i>
of the Di Doménico brothers,

591
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:24,800
SPEAKER_04: <i>the audience couldn't bear to see</i>
the images of the hero dying

SPEAKER_04: <i>nor could they bare seeing his assassins.</i>

593
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,939
SPEAKER_04: <i>The public opinion</i>
reacted radically

SPEAKER_04: <i>In their defense, the Italians,</i>

596

SPEAKER_04: <i>who due to the public harassment</i>
could never make a film again

597

images of Christ dying on the cross.

of protecting the image of Christ dying

600
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,967
SPEAKER_04: <i>it is because Christ reincarnates</i>
in each one of those images.

601
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,537
SPEAKER_04: <i>To adore those images</i>
is to adore the Christ,

SPEAKER_04: <i>those images create the</i>
world of Christianity.

603
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,011
SPEAKER_04: <i>Thus, the Italians thought</i>

604

SPEAKER_04: <i>that a State is also the</i>
sum of all its images.

the images of Rafael Uribe Uribe dying

606
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:22,158
SPEAKER_04: <i>was opting for a country incapable of</i>
imagining and thinking about their dead.

607
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:29,797
SPEAKER_04: <i>The first film of the Colombian Cinema,</i>

holding the patriotic symbols.

610

614
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:56,225
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the events that surrounded it, </i>
allow us to see from a new perspective,

SPEAKER_04: <i>the images made by Rafael Reyes </i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>but on the reaction that </i>
the public has before them.

618

SPEAKER_04: <i>Rafael Reyes and Thomas Edison</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>On the contrary,</i>

622

the death of a beloved political leader

SPEAKER_04: <i>and hurt the sensitivity of the national</i>
public, the images were destroyed.

624
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:32,293
SPEAKER_04: <i>This shows that the images</i>
collect a sensitivity.

625
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:34,829
SPEAKER_04: <i>A sensitivity that</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>These events also reveal</i>
something even simpler:

628
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:45,341
SPEAKER_04: <i>the survival of certain</i>
images leads to sympathy

are deaths worthy of mourning

01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,844
SPEAKER_04: <i>I wonder if, with the purpose</i>
of telling about these crimes

651
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:27,548
SPEAKER_04: <i>the best way wouldn’t have been through</i>
images invoking the real victims

652
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:32,787
SPEAKER_04: <i>the bodies of the executed youths, the</i>
testimonies of the relatives, the witnesses

653
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,556
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the people who actually</i>
suffered it in life.

654
01:16:35,623 --> 01:16:39,560
SPEAKER_04: <i>However, I suspect that the same </i>
thing would happened

655
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,364
SPEAKER_04: <i>as it did, when they were first broadcasted </i>
in television across the country.

656
01:16:43,497 --> 01:16:47,536
SPEAKER_04: <i>We would simply close our eyes</i>
to avoid feeling those deaths.

657
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:55,409
SPEAKER_04: <i>When the "false positives" were presented</i>
as victories of the National Army

658
01:16:55,476 --> 01:16:58,145
SPEAKER_04: <i>they were celebrated and widespread deaths.</i>

659
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,783
SPEAKER_04: <i>But when those same dead people were</i>
stripped of their insurgent disguise

660
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,086
SPEAKER_04: <i>and turned into state crimes</i>

661
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:06,854
SPEAKER_04: <i>they didn't become a scandalous image.</i>

662
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:11,893
SPEAKER_04: <i>There was something about the theater they</i>
represented, that the audience clung to.

663
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:16,163
SPEAKER_04: <i>Perhaps, this is what the</i>
"false positives" warn us from.

664
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,801
SPEAKER_04: <i>That much of the way we feel about</i>
the deaths of the war in the country

665
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:23,137
SPEAKER_04: <i>is build upon the field of</i>
appearances and images.

666
01:17:24,405 --> 01:17:27,376
SPEAKER_04: <i>The representations that have</i>
been made of the violent events

667
01:17:27,408 --> 01:17:31,546
SPEAKER_04: <i>have directed our sensitivity, making the</i>
war of the country seem tolerable for us

668
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:35,149
SPEAKER_04: <i>as long as the dead ones remain the same.</i>

669
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,920
SPEAKER_04: <i>The images have become</i>
an instrument of war.

670
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,189
SPEAKER_04: <i>A war is also the history </i>
of its images.

671
01:18:02,676 --> 01:18:06,914
SPEAKER_04: <i>♪ With justice and truth</i>
next to the people it is

687
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:16,784
SPEAKER_04: <i>I found a recording made by my mother.</i>

688
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:22,056
SPEAKER_04: <i>It’s special because she doesn’t appear,</i>
instead her voice is heard.

689
01:19:24,091 --> 01:19:26,927
SPEAKER_04: <i>Near the end she says my name.</i>
