1
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:45,145
SPEAKER_05: I had been in the army for three years,
until I got kicked out...

2
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:51,350
SPEAKER_05: because there were some corpses
that had to be buried.

3
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:55,789
SPEAKER_05: My lieutenant gave me
the order to bury them.

4
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,029
SPEAKER_05: But I didn’t. Instead I sold them
to some people who approached me.

5
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:06,733
SPEAKER_05: They wanted me to sell them.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,602
SPEAKER_05: That they would use them for a play...

7
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,406
SPEAKER_05: or something like that.

8
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,944
SPEAKER_05: They told me not to worry,
that nobody would find out.

9
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,748
SPEAKER_05: So I believed them and
I sold them the corpses.

10
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:27,620
SPEAKER_05: I found out later what they
were really going to do with them.

11
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,924
SPEAKER_05: They would disguise them

12
00:01:31,356 --> 00:01:36,596
SPEAKER_05: and leave them in the mountains as
if they would have died in combat.

13
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:41,900
SPEAKER_05: I kept silence until they were
declared as "false positives".

14
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:54,980
SPEAKER_05: MUTE FIRE

15
00:01:55,981 --> 00:02:01,688
SPEAKER_05: On February 10th 1906, four men
tried to murder the president of Colombia.

16
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:08,794
SPEAKER_05: The staging of that event, was the
beginning of cinema in the country.

17
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,537
SPEAKER_04: <i>The newspaper "Correo Nacional",</i>

18
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:54,806
SPEAKER_04: <i>published in Bogotá on March 6th, 1906,</i>

19
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,111
SPEAKER_04: <i>the exact and vivid account</i>
of the execution of four men

20
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,282
SPEAKER_04: <i>for the attempt of murder of</i>
the General Rafael Reyes,

21
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,683
SPEAKER_04: <i>by that time president</i>
of Colombia.

22
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:16,763
SPEAKER_04: <i>Marco Arturo Salgar, Carlos Roberto Gonzalez,</i>
Juan Ortiz and Fernando Aguilar.

23
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:21,033
SPEAKER_04: <i>were the four men sentenced</i>
to death, and in consequence

24
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:25,305
SPEAKER_04: <i>shot in the same place where</i>
they committed the crime.

25
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:30,776
SPEAKER_04: <i>The account, whose author's</i>
name remains unknown,

26
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:32,679
SPEAKER_04: <i>is extremely detailed.</i>

27
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:38,418
SPEAKER_04: <i>For example, he describes one by one the kind</i>
of hat that each condemned was wearing.

28
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,587
SPEAKER_04: <i>It’s worth quoting the whole fragment:</i>

29
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:46,491
SPEAKER_04: <i>"They were all wearing black:</i>
Salgar wore a straight wing cinnamon hat.

30
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,262
SPEAKER_04: <i>Aguilar wore a Panama hat.</i>

31
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,331
SPEAKER_04: <i>Gonzales, a black Tyrolean hat.</i>

32
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:55,235
SPEAKER_04: <i>And Ortiz wore a black hard hat."</i>

33
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,838
SPEAKER_04: <i>The reporter also collects</i>
a series of interviews.

34
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:06,145
SPEAKER_04: <i>The most striking is perhaps, the one from</i>
the Captain of Executions, who just says,

35
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,983
SPEAKER_04: <i>in a serious tone I'd guess:</i>
"Nothing is sacred".

36
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:18,190
SPEAKER_04: <i>The reporter states: "The shooting</i>
proceeds as normal.

37
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:21,694
SPEAKER_04: <i>Given the signal with his sword</i>
by the Captain of Executions,

38
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,630
SPEAKER_04: <i>the first round of shooting</i>
resounds from the rifles.

39
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,470
SPEAKER_04: <i>Afterwards, a group of doctors approaches</i>

40
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,305
SPEAKER_04: <i>and certify that the condemned</i>
are still breathing,

41
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,774
SPEAKER_04: <i>and give the order for</i>
a second shooting,

42
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,110
SPEAKER_04: <i>which ends with the immediate</i>
entrance of the four coffins

43
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,680
SPEAKER_04: <i>to transport the corpses</i>
to the cemetery."

44
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,494
SPEAKER_04: <i>This time, the event is more relevant than</i>
usually, since president Rafael Reyes

45
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:58,298
SPEAKER_04: <i>guided by this moment of political</i>
instability, makes an exception

46
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,701
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the shooting doesn't take place in</i>
the courtyard of the School of Infantry,

47
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,771
SPEAKER_04: <i>where it would normally happened.</i>

48
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:08,675
SPEAKER_04: <i>Instead, it's held in a public area,</i>
in front of over 10,000 people.

49
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:21,053
SPEAKER_04: <i>Rafael Reyes saw here the</i>
remains of the last civil war

50
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:25,358
SPEAKER_04: <i>that had ended only four years ago,</i>
and still had the country in agony.

51
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:30,295
SPEAKER_04: <i>Shooting people of his same</i>
political party in public areas,

52
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,165
SPEAKER_04: <i>was for him a sign of authority,</i>

53
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:35,767
SPEAKER_04: <i>but also an invitation to end</i>
the traditional divide

54
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:38,937
SPEAKER_04: <i>between the liberal</i>
and the conservative party.

55
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,511
SPEAKER_04: <i>With the purpose of making this shooting</i>
visible to as many people as possible

56
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:51,550
SPEAKER_04: <i>Reyes publishes the book "February 10th",</i>
telling the events through photos.

57
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:56,389
SPEAKER_04: <i>Reyes thought that, just like the people</i>
who witnessed the shooting in person did,

58
00:05:56,588 --> 00:06:01,728
SPEAKER_04: <i>everyone who saw those photos</i>
would immediately support his idea.

59
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,367
SPEAKER_04: <i>Nevertheless, the most interesting</i>
part of this series of photos

60
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,372
SPEAKER_04: <i>happens after the moment</i>
of the cemetery picture.

61
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:22,048
SPEAKER_04: <i>It’s unknown whose idea it was, but due to the</i>
impact caused by the pictures of the execution

62
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,053
SPEAKER_04: <i>president Rafael Reyes, Chief of police</i>
Pedro Pedraza, and photographer Lino Lara

63
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:32,290
SPEAKER_04: <i>decided together to recreate</i>
the moments before the shooting.

64
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,394
SPEAKER_04: <i>They decided to recreate</i>
the attack on the president

65
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,798
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the capture of the condemned,</i>
to create a story.

66
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:06,858
SPEAKER_04: <i>The outcome was what the historians</i>
called a "false document".

67
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:12,899
SPEAKER_04: <i>From the 22 pictures that make up</i>
the story, 18 are theatrical reenactments.

68
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:19,639
SPEAKER_04: <i>This is the first time of a tale made</i>
through photographs in Colombia.

69
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:23,074
SPEAKER_04: <i>This little narrative gesture,</i>
is acknowledged by tradition

70
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,377
SPEAKER_04: <i>as the beginning of</i>
filmmaking in the country.

71
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,531
SPEAKER_04: <i>Here lays the body of Rafael Reyes today.</i>

72
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,406
SPEAKER_04: <i>This was going to be a movie about the</i>
beginnings of Cinema in Colombia,

73
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,141
SPEAKER_04: <i>about its first images.</i>

74
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,911
SPEAKER_04: <i>But as it's being said:</i>

75
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,580
SPEAKER_04: <i>To talk about Colombia</i>
we have to talk about war.

76
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:39,251
SPEAKER_04: <i>And to talk about war we need to talk about</i>
armies, about deaths, about cemeteries.

77
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:44,823
SPEAKER_04: <i>At the same time, my house and my</i>
parents house looked like a cemetery.

78
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:50,296
SPEAKER_04: <i>It felt like haunted by an inert current,</i>
like flooded by murky water

79
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,899
SPEAKER_04: <i>or better, by dead water.</i>

80
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:58,303
SPEAKER_04: <i>A few months ago my mother</i>
had an episode of mutism,

81
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:01,173
SPEAKER_04: <i>and without any explanation,</i>
she just stopped talking.

82
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,243
SPEAKER_04: <i>I remember with some nostalgia</i>

83
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:08,880
SPEAKER_04: <i>how she repeated the words of that</i>
Mexican musician while cooking:

84
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:12,485
SPEAKER_04: <i>that said something like:</i>
"I wish you to be happy, very happy...

85
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,921
SPEAKER_04: <i>I wish you to find love,</i>
because you deserve it"

86
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:20,058
SPEAKER_04: <i>I read somewhere that the first thing you</i>
forget about a person is the voice.

87
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,099
SPEAKER_04: <i>Affected by this</i>
familiar incident,

88
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,168
SPEAKER_04: <i>and because of what connects</i>
all things together

89
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:33,072
SPEAKER_04: <i>maybe the first moments</i>
of national cinema

90
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,308
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the muteness of my mother can</i>
be part of the same scenario.

91
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,211
SPEAKER_04: <i>Like when you look at a surface</i>
where shadows are being projected

92
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:44,149
SPEAKER_04: <i>and you can't tell each</i>
object from the other apart.

93
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,110
SPEAKER_04: <i>One night my father woke up and saw</i>
the light of the bathroom on.

94
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,980
SPEAKER_04: <i>When he came closer, he saw my mother in</i>
front of the mirror, shaking.

95
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,783
SPEAKER_04: <i>My father hugged her and</i>
asked her what was going on,

96
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,519
SPEAKER_04: <i>he asked her if she</i>
had a bad dream

97
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,354
SPEAKER_04: <i>but she couldn’t answer.</i>

98
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,456
SPEAKER_04: <i>Since that moment,</i>
she has never spoken again.

99
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:17,643
SPEAKER_04: <i>My mother spent most of the time locked in a</i>
room looking at people through the window.

100
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:40,566
SPEAKER_04: <i>Her presence had become more and</i>
more unbearable for my father

101
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:45,571
SPEAKER_04: <i>who couldn’t avoid feeling sometimes</i>
guilty, and sometimes cheated.

102
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,075
SPEAKER_04: <i>The ambiguity of the doctors answers</i>
left a bad feeling behind

103
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,077
SPEAKER_04: <i>which made him think</i>
that she was just pretending.

104
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,224
SPEAKER_04: <i>One day, a worker of the family suggested</i>
to try with another type of specialist

105
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:10,395
SPEAKER_04: <i>from his point of view, my mother's</i>
muteness was due to a powerful spell.

106
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:18,336
SPEAKER_04: <i>My father agreed, even if it</i>
would make him feel humiliated

107
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,539
SPEAKER_04: <i>because for him, superstitions</i>
were for fools.

108
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:26,111
SPEAKER_04: <i>After two weeks some kind of chaman</i>
or warlock came to my mother.

109
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:31,917
SPEAKER_04: <i>After wandering around the house, where some</i>
kind of weird mantle could certainly be felt

110
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:36,355
SPEAKER_04: <i>like a thick, rancid</i>
smell, he told my father:

111
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,058
SPEAKER_04: <i>"Your problems have a</i>
solution, don’t worry.

112
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,861
SPEAKER_04: <i>You just have to</i>
sell this house,

113
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:47,533
SPEAKER_04: <i>and leave somewhere visible a valuable</i>
object and a picture of her."

114
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,004
SPEAKER_04: <i>My father did so.</i>

115
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:57,243
SPEAKER_04: <i>The house was put on sale, and on a</i>
shelf he left a picture of her

116
00:12:57,275 --> 00:13:01,312
SPEAKER_04: <i>and a black stone that she</i>
held like a luck charm.

117
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,418
SPEAKER_09: Please, put your legs up.

118
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:18,250
SPEAKER_07: There’s a line dividing the brain
into a left and a right hemisphere.

119
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:24,023
SPEAKER_07: Usually, in most people,
the left hemisphere

120
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:26,991
SPEAKER_07: dominates language.

121
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:32,464
SPEAKER_07: Language works in two important parts.
One part is in the temporal lobe.

122
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:39,038
SPEAKER_07: The one responsible for perception
and comprehension of any language.

123
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,440
SPEAKER_07: And the other one in the frontal lobe

124
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,544
SPEAKER_07: that’s directly responsible
for performing words.

125
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:52,551
SPEAKER_07: So that words can coordinate a coherent
answer according to the understood question.

126
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:56,054
SPEAKER_07: A coherent and adequate answer.

127
00:15:56,154 --> 00:16:01,460
SPEAKER_07: In your case, we’re hoping that you
understand the things we’re asking you.

128
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,895
SPEAKER_07: And in case you would
have any difficulties,

129
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:08,767
SPEAKER_07: we would find some structural injury
in this part that could be either a tumor

130
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,172
SPEAKER_07: or a scar of some cerebral stroke
that you might have had.

131
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:18,744
SPEAKER_07: No injury, no tumor.
Analyzing the neurological exam

132
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:24,482
SPEAKER_07: and this last generation
exam, we can conclude

133
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,754
SPEAKER_07: that Aracellys brain is completely normal.

134
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:14,932
SPEAKER_07: <i><font color='#f3cf1f'>- Ok. What's your name?</font></i>

<i><font color='#f3cf1f'>She will ask so you can answer that...</font></i>

141
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,270
SPEAKER_04: <i>There’s an announcement on</i>
the internet that says:

142
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,775
SPEAKER_04: <i>"Recover all important moments of</i>
your life that are kept in old tapes.

SPEAKER_04: <i>Live those unique moments with</i>
your family and friends again.

SPEAKER_04: <i>All formats, Betacam SP,</i>
VHS, DV, mini DV, 8mm…"

145
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,125
SPEAKER_04: <i>I contacted the advertiser.</i>

146
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:18,163
SPEAKER_04: <i>That same afternoon, in a country</i>
house on the outskirts of the city,

147
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:19,964
SPEAKER_04: <i>I got to meet Carlos Pelbet,</i>

148
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:23,501
SPEAKER_04: <i>founder of an old audiovisual company</i>
that he and his brother had

149
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,770
SPEAKER_04: <i>since the beginning of the 80s.</i>

150
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,913
SPEAKER_04: <i>Carlos told me rapidly about</i>
his interest in films

151
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,951
SPEAKER_04: <i>or rather, he told me that at some</i>
point of his life it was of his interest.

152
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,452
SPEAKER_04: <i>Also that Pelbet, his company,</i>

153
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:45,557
SPEAKER_04: <i>inaugurated the recording and broadcasting</i>
business of soccer matches in Colombia

154
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:50,695
SPEAKER_04: <i>and that it was right then, when competing with</i>
the big TV channels, that the company broke.

155
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:54,732
SPEAKER_04: <i>He told me that a few years ago he started </i>
collecting anonymous family home movies

156
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:59,637
SPEAKER_04: <i>from the cassettes that he digitizes.</i>
Hours and hours of family events

157
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:05,277
SPEAKER_04: <i>weddings, first communions, birthdays,</i>
baptisms, Christmas and holidays.

158
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,263
SPEAKER_04: <i>In a sense, my film is</i>
a relative of all these images,

159
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:08,467
SPEAKER_04: <i>of the personal images of everyday rites.</i>

160
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,537
SPEAKER_04: <i>Carlos tells me that each week, a</i>
different youngster arrives at his door

161
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,940
SPEAKER_04: <i>wanting to digitize</i>
images of his family

162
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,842
SPEAKER_04: <i>with an idea similar to mine:</i>

163
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,278
SPEAKER_04: <i>To make a film about their mothers,</i>
fathers or grandparents.

164
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:25,049
SPEAKER_04: <i>Apparently more people are doing the</i>
same film as me at this moment.

165
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:28,252
SPEAKER_04: <i>We are all thinking about the same images.</i>

166
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,378
SPEAKER_04: <i>These are some images taken by my mother.</i>

167
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:59,084
SPEAKER_04: <i>A movie about a play in</i>
a rural school she worked at.

168
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,821
SPEAKER_04: <i>Back then, she sympathized with the</i>
insurgent groups of the country.

169
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,961
SPEAKER_04: <i>That’s me.</i>

170
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,813
SPEAKER_04: <i>In one of the movie cans,</i>
it was written on a white tape:

171
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:04,482
SPEAKER_04: <i>"Marquetalia, 1964".</i>

172
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:09,587
SPEAKER_04: <i>Those are the place and the date</i>
where the famous FARC was founded.

173
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:15,026
SPEAKER_04: <i>Apparently, the play is about a popular</i>
narration about the first combats

174
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,130
SPEAKER_04: <i>between the FARC guerilla </i>
and the National Army.

175
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,232
SPEAKER_04: <i>The story is the following:</i>

176
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,978
SPEAKER_04: <i>Having the intention of avoiding the</i>
expansion of the communist guerrilla,

177
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,449
SPEAKER_04: <i>on May 18th, 1964 president</i>
Guillermo León Valencia

178
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:40,618
SPEAKER_04: <i>sends over a thousand soldiers</i>
to the Tolima plateau

179
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:45,790
SPEAKER_04: <i>in search for a suspected FARC camp with</i>
48 members of the insurgent movement in it.

180
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:51,829
SPEAKER_04: <i>After nine days of intense</i>
wandering, the group of soldiers,

181
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,965
SPEAKER_04: <i>lead by Lieutenant Colonel</i>
José Joaquín Matallana,

182
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:59,171
SPEAKER_04: <i>starts suspecting that they’re wrong, </i>
that there’s no such camp.

183
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,476
SPEAKER_04: <i>They quickly realize that the insurgents</i>
are not full time soldiers,

184
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,478
SPEAKER_04: <i>and that most of them actually</i>

185
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,382
SPEAKER_04: <i>have a disguised life as farmers </i>
among the civilians.

186
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,252
SPEAKER_04: <i>A question immediately arose:</i>

187
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:20,224
SPEAKER_04: <i>How to tell the population, most of them</i>
farmers, from the guerrillas apart?

188
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,529
SPEAKER_04: <i>Facing this, Colonel</i>
José Joaquín Matallana,

189
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,567
SPEAKER_04: <i>who considered himself as an</i>
analytic and methodic person

190
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,970
SPEAKER_04: <i>and an innovating strategist,</i>
thought to have the answer.

191
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:37,209
SPEAKER_04: <i>He explains to his soldiers: "This problem</i>
is essentially about appearances".

192
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:42,113
SPEAKER_04: <i>Matallana ordered his soldiers to go</i>
after every man and woman of the area

193
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,983
SPEAKER_04: <i>and force them to wear the</i>
guerrilla uniform in front of them.

194
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:50,255
SPEAKER_04: <i>Matallana assured his soldiers,</i>

195
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:53,592
SPEAKER_04: <i>that the uniform had the</i>
strength and essential capacity

196
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,626
SPEAKER_04: <i>to reveal someone's identity.</i>

197
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,730
SPEAKER_04: <i>According to his logic,</i>
wearing the uniform

198
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:03,367
SPEAKER_04: <i>would immediately reveal if the person </i>
was a real guerilla soldier or not.

199
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:33,064
SPEAKER_04: <i>After two weeks they had captured 52 people,</i>
including five children and eight elderly.

200
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,067
SPEAKER_04: <i>This idea would be known later</i>
as the Matallana logic.

201
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,804
SPEAKER_04: <i>And what could have been a</i>
brilliant military operation,

202
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:42,673
SPEAKER_04: <i>ended up being one of the biggest</i>
political failures in history

203
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:47,913
SPEAKER_04: <i>because, in less than two years, those 48</i>
soldiers would later turn into five thousand.

204
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:56,020
SPEAKER_04: <i>From then on, the idea of the disguised</i>
guerrilla would become an obsession

205
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,557
SPEAKER_04: <i>in the development of</i>
public opinion in the country.

206
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,160
SPEAKER_04: <i>Throughout the years, the question</i>
would be incessantly repeated:

207
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,029
SPEAKER_04: <i>Who’s really from the guerilla, </i>
and who’s not?

208
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,958
SPEAKER_04: <i>More than 20 years ago</i>
my mother filmed me.

209
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,559
SPEAKER_04: <i>Today, I’m filming her.</i>

210
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:47,571
SPEAKER_04: <i>Seeing myself in that play, </i>
playing role of a farmer

211
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:51,108
SPEAKER_04: <i>captured by the army and forced </i>
to dress like a guerilla man

212
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:55,547
SPEAKER_04: <i>I couldn’t avoid thinking of the</i>
recent events of the war in Colombia.

213
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:11,296
SPEAKER_04: <i>Thousands of innocent young people were </i>
captured by the National Army of Colombia

214
00:27:11,328 --> 00:27:16,233
SPEAKER_04: <i>and taken to different parts </i>
of the country to be murdered later.

215
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,203
SPEAKER_04: <i>Then, their bodies were</i>
dressed up like guerilla-soldier

216
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,973
SPEAKER_04: <i>and presented in front of the</i>
media like military successes.

217
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:26,744
SPEAKER_04: <i>It was a systematic</i>
falsification of war events.

218
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,714
SPEAKER_04: <i>Stagings, using real victims</i>
to create a story.

219
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:42,727
SPEAKER_04: <i>By the year 2008, this practice</i>
was so common in the National Army

220
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:46,964
SPEAKER_04: <i>that the victims of this type of</i>
crime counted to the present day

221
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,468
SPEAKER_04: <i>are more than the missing people </i>
during the dictatorship in Chile.

222
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:41,519
SPEAKER_04: <i>During the 1960s,</i>

223
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,655
SPEAKER_04: <i>in search of images of</i>
true revolutionaries,

224
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,392
SPEAKER_04: <i>two French filmmakers</i>
travelled to Riochiquito,

SPEAKER_04: <i>located in the north of</i>
the province of Cauca.

226
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:55,400
SPEAKER_04: <i>They recorded there the activities</i>
of the recently founded FARC.

227
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:02,973
SPEAKER_12: In 1964, the government
started a persecution again.

228
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:09,814
SPEAKER_12: This time, with 16,000 men ordered to wipe
out completely with the organization.

229
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:14,486
SPEAKER_12: But again, they encountered with
the resistance of the farmers

230
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:21,459
SPEAKER_12: and instead of ending it, the movement
has spread and got even stronger.

231
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,465
SPEAKER_12: Since in June 1964 we had already...

232
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:34,506
SPEAKER_12: created a program that was already
well known by the public opinion.

233
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:37,942
SPEAKER_12: Many other revolutionary
movements have also joined in.

234
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:42,446
SPEAKER_12: They also agree with it and
will fight together with us.

235
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,984
SPEAKER_04: <i>According to a French article called</i>
"Cinema declares war on us"

236

SPEAKER_04: <i>the screening of this movie</i>

237
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:52,523
SPEAKER_04: <i>generated an unexpected anguish</i>

238
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:56,394
SPEAKER_04: <i>Apparently, proving the</i>
existence of revolutionary life

239

SPEAKER_04: <i>radically buried any other</i>
alternative of life.

240

SPEAKER_04: <i>For the young Parisians of that time</i>

241

SPEAKER_04: <i>nothing could be compared to the idea</i>

243
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:11,009

00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:13,357
SPEAKER_04: <i>and only during morning hours.</i>

260
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,194
SPEAKER_04: <i>From those two days, a brief</i>
correspondence between Lino Lara

261
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,930
SPEAKER_04: <i>and General Pedro Pedraza</i>
hast been preserved.

262
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:23,334
SPEAKER_04: <i>Here, after making it clear</i>
that he’s also a photographer

263
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,971
SPEAKER_04: <i>and not a superstitious person,</i>
officer Pedraza asks himself:

264
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,740
SPEAKER_04: <i>is there any risk in imitating the dead?</i>

265
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,377
SPEAKER_04: <i>There is no known answer from</i>
Lino Lara to this question.

266
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:38,316
SPEAKER_04: <i>In fact, very little </i>
is known about him.

267
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:42,452
SPEAKER_04: <i>In contrast, a lot has been</i>
written about these photographs

268
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:46,923
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the importance of violent </i>
events reenactments in the country.

269
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:59,871
SPEAKER_04: <i>It's easy to think that the idea of</i>
this first tale has been influenced

270
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,906
SPEAKER_04: <i>by some of the first films</i>
of Thomas Alva Edison

271
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,210
SPEAKER_04: <i>in which episodes of famous</i>
executions are recreated.

272
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,608
SPEAKER_04: <i>For example: Here they recreate </i>
the death of Leon Czolgosz

273
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:16,746
SPEAKER_04: <i>a Polish anarchist sentenced to death for the</i>
murder of the president of the United States,

274
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:20,384
SPEAKER_04: <i>William McKinley, on</i>
September the 6th, 1901.

275
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,217
SPEAKER_04: <i>Edison's goal was to</i>
publicize the electric chair

276
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:58,255
SPEAKER_04: <i>to make it the new method of execution in</i>
the country and replace the gallows.

277
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:02,592
SPEAKER_04: <i>He knew that neither technology, nor</i>
his inventions were neutral

278
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:06,731
SPEAKER_04: <i>and since electricity could be</i>
turned into a killing device

279
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,132
SPEAKER_04: <i>the cinematograph and the pictures</i>

280
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:14,472
SPEAKER_04: <i>could also unleash very useful energies </i>
for the project of a country.

281
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:08,525
SPEAKER_04: <i>These landscapes of the Magdalena river</i>

282
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:12,663
SPEAKER_04: <i>were recorded in photographs </i>
by Rafael Reyes in 1909.

283
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:17,601
SPEAKER_04: <i>Back then, the former president dedicated himself</i>
to travel around the unknown national territory

284
00:37:17,601 --> 00:37:22,239
SPEAKER_04: <i>thinking about how Colombian cinema could be</i>
used according to the project of a country.

285
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,876
SPEAKER_04: <i>The result of this 22-day-long</i>
adventure was a book called:

286
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:29,780
SPEAKER_04: <i>"Presidential excursions,</i>
notes from a travel journal."

287
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:36,820
SPEAKER_04: <i>The book contains a detailed inventory of</i>
the main natural resources of the country

288
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:41,125
SPEAKER_04: <i>in relation to the industrial means</i>
necessary for its exploitation.

289
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,326
SPEAKER_04: <i>For instance:</i>

290
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,664
SPEAKER_04: <i>there's a list of the total length of</i>
the railway tracks of each province

291
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:52,036
SPEAKER_04: <i>in relation to the increase of hectares</i>
cultivated year by year since 1895.

292
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,724
SPEAKER_04: <i>Reyes intended to boost</i>
several trades,

293
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,893
SPEAKER_04: <i>especially in the areas</i>
of banana plantations.

294
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,396
SPEAKER_04: <i>Therefore, articles from</i>
French and English magazines

295
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,766
SPEAKER_04: <i>recommending the consumption</i>
of bananas were included

296
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:26,003
SPEAKER_04: <i>arguing that bananas were the most</i>
hygienic and nutritious fruit of them all.

297
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,141
SPEAKER_04: <i>At the same time, this documentation is</i>
accompanied by a series of photographs

298
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:35,512
SPEAKER_04: <i>that privilege images of landscapes,</i>
agricultural colonies, train tracks

299
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:39,115
SPEAKER_04: <i>prominent personalities of the</i>
industrial world and workers.

300
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,519
SPEAKER_04: <i>This book was the first visual</i>
record of the national territory.

301
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:46,556
SPEAKER_04: <i>Rafael Reyes described it as</i>
an "explained cinematograph".

302
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,056
SPEAKER_04: Banana field blueprint

303
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:03,199
SPEAKER_04: <i>The truth was, Rafael Reyes did not only</i>
intend to create a catalog of wealths

304
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,902
SPEAKER_04: <i>to allure foreign multinationals.</i>

305
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,840
SPEAKER_04: <i>His true purpose was to create a</i>
unified image of the country,

306
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,208
SPEAKER_04: <i>which due to the characteristics</i>
of its geography

307
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:15,311
SPEAKER_04: <i>suffered from a great lack of</i>
communication among its regions

308
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:20,518
SPEAKER_04: <i>which by the time was already producing great</i>
losses in large portions of the territory.

309
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:26,791
SPEAKER_04: <i>Rafael Reyes was looking for something a</i>
little more elusive and much more dangerous.

310
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,730
SPEAKER_04: <i>He was sure that all people of the</i>
country should be united by something,

311
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,434
SPEAKER_04: <i>a supposed "national essence" that </i>
would prevent their dismemberment.

312
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,869
SPEAKER_04: <i>He asked himself: What are we?</i>

313
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,905
SPEAKER_04: <i>The result of a discrete genocide?</i>

314
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,240
SPEAKER_04: <i>Or are we the occasional guardians</i>
of infinite clusters of gold

315
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:47,677
SPEAKER_04: <i>and immense expanses of water</i>
that turn into fruits?

316
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,353
SPEAKER_04: <i>Driven by the scientific spirit of the time</i>

317
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,358
SPEAKER_04: <i>Reyes saw in the photographic device</i>
the best tool to look for that essence.

318
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:14,070
SPEAKER_04: <i>He thought: If photographs can capture,</i>
better than anything else in the world

319
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:19,076
SPEAKER_04: <i>the outstanding feature of the identity of</i>
a subject that is, of course, his face

320
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,445
SPEAKER_04: <i>why wouldn’t it be able,</i>
with enough effort,

321
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:25,682
SPEAKER_04: <i>to reveal the image of the true face</i>
of these lands and thus, its identity?

322
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:32,789
SPEAKER_04: <i>A group of the right images</i>
can unify the country.

323
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:04,855
SPEAKER_04: <i>Thus, Rafael Reyes begins like this</i>
with his obsession with portraits

324
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:10,793
SPEAKER_04: <i>which would result in the most significant</i>
image of the book and possibly of the time:

325
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,302
SPEAKER_04: <i>The portrait of cacique</i>
José Dolores and his wife

326
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,672
SPEAKER_04: <i>holding a portrait of former </i>
President Rafael Reyes.

327
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:26,510
SPEAKER_04: <i>It has been thought, quite often,</i>

328
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,913
SPEAKER_04: <i>that Reyes was saying only one</i>
thing with this photograph:

329
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:31,315
SPEAKER_04: <i>I am Colombia.</i>

330
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,179
SPEAKER_04: <i>The photographs of Rafael Reyes </i>
and Lino Lara

331
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:06,550
SPEAKER_04: <i>represented a technological</i>
innovation for the country.

332
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,152
SPEAKER_04: <i>From this moment on,</i>

333
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:12,755
SPEAKER_04: <i>the way in which the different events were</i>
narrated would be radically transformed.

334
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:18,329
SPEAKER_04: <i>They marked the beginning of an informative</i>
treatment based on the display of images.

335
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:49,259
SPEAKER_04: <i>For those who, like myself, have experienced the</i>
war in Colombia exclusively through images

336
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,663
SPEAKER_04: <i>those of television,</i>
magazines and newspapers;

337
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:56,000
SPEAKER_04: <i>the figure of Rafael Rayes</i>
asks us a question:

338
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:01,204
SPEAKER_04: <i>Is there any link between the production of</i>
images and the war events in the country?

339
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:15,318
SPEAKER_04: <i>Over the years, the question about who’s</i>
a guerilla combatant and who’s not,

340
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:17,121
SPEAKER_04: <i>suffers a transformation.</i>

341
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,557
SPEAKER_04: <i>It mutates, becoming the obsession</i>
for one specific image:

342
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,193
SPEAKER_04: <i>The image of the dead guerilla.</i>

343
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:29,599
SPEAKER_04: <i>The image of the insurgent murdered</i>
at hands of agents of the State

344

SPEAKER_04: <i>is spread through all</i>
screens of the country.

345
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:35,806
SPEAKER_04: <i>In a short time, it manages to dominate</i>
the imagination of public opinion

346
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:39,242
SPEAKER_04: <i>and its production is furiously</i>
demanded from everywhere.

347
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:43,646
SPEAKER_04: <i>"¡More images!", says the</i>
redactor to the journalist,

348
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,516
SPEAKER_04: <i>the editor to the photographer,</i>

every day", says the president.

350

heard in schools

SPEAKER_04: <i>bars, stores, churches, houses;</i>
among friends and family.

352
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,768
SPEAKER_04: <i>Then, the horror came.</i>

353
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:09,773
SPEAKER_04: <i>It was discovered that many of those bodies,</i>
and in consequence many of those images

354
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,309
SPEAKER_04: <i>didn’t belong to authentic guerilla-soldier.</i>

355
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,045
SPEAKER_04: <i>That the bodies were </i>
of young innocents disguised,

356
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,047
SPEAKER_04: <i>that everything was a staging</i>

357
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:22,920
SPEAKER_04: <i>and that the testimonies of the soldiers</i>
were also reproductions of other combats.

358
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:36,032
SPEAKER_04: <i>The response of the audience</i>
to that truth was apathy.

SPEAKER_04: <i>We all said: Those are the mothers of</i>
the youngsters called "false positives".

SPEAKER_04: <i>Nobody said: I’m the one</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>We just said:</i>

363

SPEAKER_04: <i>Real deaths put in combat scenarios</i>

368

SPEAKER_04: <i>as if the war events in the country would</i>
have been replaced by some kind of parody

369
00:46:17,907 --> 00:46:20,878
SPEAKER_04: <i>by an evil imitation created by war itself.</i>

370
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,882
SPEAKER_04: <i>As if after all these years, the war would</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>its own copies.</i>

372
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,858
SPEAKER_04: <i>In 1906, Rafael Reyes</i>
created a "false document"

SPEAKER_04: <i>to produce a story</i>
about an execution.

SPEAKER_04: <i>Over time, that image had become</i>
boring to her, kind of obvious, pathetic.

388

SPEAKER_04: <i>Nevertheless,</i>

389
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,579
SPEAKER_04: <i>she had lately started to feel curious about</i>
the identity of the man who drove the car.

390
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,550
SPEAKER_04: <i>She told me: "I’ve been wondering</i>
lately how his hands would be, his lips,

391
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,353
SPEAKER_04: <i>the shape of his teeth. </i>
I want to know his name".

392
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,472
SPEAKER_10: Are you having fun?

393
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,204
SPEAKER_10: <i>More, more, more!</i>

394
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:26,322
SPEAKER_10: <i>- Are you all right?</i>
- Yes!

395
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:30,226
SPEAKER_10: Come then, so you can
get some water on you.

396
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,277
SPEAKER_04: <i>My mother has spent the last few months</i>
between hospitals and this house.

397
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,079
SPEAKER_04: <i>The house of Maria, her best friend.</i>

398
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,516
SPEAKER_04: <i>After several months,</i>

399
00:50:52,548 --> 00:50:56,920
SPEAKER_04: <i>the doctors stated that if she didn’t</i>
talk was because she didn’t want to.

400
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,023
SPEAKER_04: <i>Because they couldn’t find</i>
any reason for it.

401
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,898
SPEAKER_04: <i>Other doctors, the most pessimistic</i>
and less reserved ones,

402
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,967
SPEAKER_04: <i>made us understand that she just</i>
didn’t want to live anymore.

403
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,385
SPEAKER_04: <i>The truth is,</i>
the more time passes,

404
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:32,489
SPEAKER_04: <i>the feeling that my mother</i>
is disappearing grows.

405
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:36,960
SPEAKER_04: <i>Somehow, every day her presence</i>
resembles more of a ghost.

406
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:41,864
SPEAKER_04: <i>It’s as if she would have escaped time,</i>
and would be merely a thought of mine.

407
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,768
SPEAKER_04: <i>Today is her birthday.</i>

408
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:52,909
SPEAKER_08: We thank the Lord because...

409
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,246
SPEAKER_08: He has given us...

410
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:02,585
SPEAKER_08: an exact and clear message...

411
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:09,492
SPEAKER_08: and we have understood that message.

412
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,929
SPEAKER_08: It's not that we have a screw loose.

413
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:20,936
SPEAKER_08: It’s not that we’re crazy,
or that we’re less than you.

414
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,641
SPEAKER_08: It's not that.

415
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:30,514
SPEAKER_08: It’s just that we accepted
to walk with Jesus Christ.

416
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,952
SPEAKER_08: That’s the difference between you and us.

417
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:39,121
SPEAKER_08: That’s why, even with fear

418
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,628
SPEAKER_08: we’re here in front of the presence of God

419
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,898
SPEAKER_08: and maybe you, my friend, will say:

420
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:52,101
SPEAKER_08: The evangelics again...

421
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:55,438
SPEAKER_08: Making noise again...

422
00:52:56,273 --> 00:53:01,677
SPEAKER_08: Those people who come here just to sing...

423
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,880
SPEAKER_08: who just…

424
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,652
SPEAKER_04: <i>During the last week, an evangelist called</i>
Ricardo Javier has been harassing my mother.

425
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,822
SPEAKER_04: <i>He stands in front of the house to talk to</i>
her about the power of the word of Jesus.

428

SPEAKER_04: <i>If we would know when a thief is coming,</i>
nobody would ever be robbed.

SPEAKER_04: <i>Gods kingdom comes when we’re not</i>
expecting it, so keep your eyes open."

439
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,851
SPEAKER_01: The strange thing was that I didn’t
notice her as worried as I was.

440
00:55:56,152 --> 00:56:00,389
SPEAKER_01: If I wake up mute I would
probably go crazy.

441
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:04,460
SPEAKER_01: I noticed it was an attitude
that she was assuming.

442
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:08,063
SPEAKER_01: I could never knew if was just
in front of me or everyone

SPEAKER_01: or facing life.

444
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,235
SPEAKER_01: Maybe she was punishing us all.

445
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:15,871
SPEAKER_01: But then she stopped speaking.

446
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,876
SPEAKER_01: I don’t think she can’t speak,
I think that she has decided not to speak.

447
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,980
SPEAKER_01: And I think it’s a voluntary decision.

448
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:28,650
SPEAKER_01: I thought, however, that it
could be a medical issue.

449
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,222
SPEAKER_01: We took her to the doctor

450
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:37,626
SPEAKER_01: I talked to Héctor, to César 
and to other people.

451
00:56:38,193 --> 00:56:40,295
SPEAKER_01: To everyone I thought could know.

452
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,632
SPEAKER_01: They all came to the
same conclusion:

453
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,336
SPEAKER_01: Aracelly's problem
is inexplicable.

454
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:53,041
SPEAKER_01: It’s not physiological, and it
doesn’t seem psychological either.

455
00:56:53,342 --> 00:56:57,447
SPEAKER_01: Always, always, always, I think
that she always understands us.

456
00:56:57,646 --> 00:57:00,849
SPEAKER_01: She hasn't lost the
capacity of understanding

457
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:04,820
SPEAKER_01: nor has she lost any
other kind of routines.

458
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,724
SPEAKER_01: She reads, she walks, she thinks,

459
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:11,661
SPEAKER_01: she insinuates, she takes initiatives.

460
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:16,266
SPEAKER_01: I think that she is taking somehow revenge.

461
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:21,237
SPEAKER_01: And I think that, somehow, what she’s pretending
is to make life unbearable to everyone.

462
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,873
SPEAKER_01: If that’s the case, she
should have said it,

463
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:27,242
SPEAKER_01: and it would have been better

464
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,746
SPEAKER_01: that we would just
have ended everything.

465
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,614
SPEAKER_01: I think that families begin

466
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:38,253
SPEAKER_01: and families dissolve, families
should not self-destruct.

467
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:42,458
SPEAKER_01: I think we never talked enough about love.

468
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,628
SPEAKER_01: Because if we had talked
enough about love

469
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,896
SPEAKER_01: we would have understood
it from the beginning.

470
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:53,135
SPEAKER_01: Love is born, it grows and it
dies like everything in nature.

471
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:59,675
SPEAKER_01: I believe that the academic attitude is not
only repeating texts in the universities

472
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:03,545
SPEAKER_01: but to live academically,
and that we have lacked.

Pelbet were very limited,

SPEAKER_04: <i>After this event, Carlos Pelbet was harassed</i>
for several days by hundreds of fanatics

522
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,324
SPEAKER_04: <i>who wanted to obtain the</i>
recordings of the game,

523
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:39,528
SPEAKER_04: <i>with the intention of studying the</i>
images very carefully themselves

524
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:42,030
SPEAKER_04: <i>together with friends and family.</i>

525
01:01:42,197 --> 01:01:45,300
SPEAKER_04: <i>Repeat them again and</i>
again, frame per frame,

526
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,304
SPEAKER_04: <i>and dissecting that instant</i>
as many times as necessary

527
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:53,208
SPEAKER_04: <i>until it spoke for itself and said</i>
if the fault was simulated or real.

528
01:01:57,045 --> 01:02:01,083
SPEAKER_04: <i>It's impossible for Carlos Pelbet </i>
to determine that kind of issue.

529
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,653
SPEAKER_04: <i>For him, there is simply no</i>
difference between someone who falls

530
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:06,989
SPEAKER_04: <i>and someone who</i>
pretends to fall.

531
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,333
SPEAKER_04: <i>More than 30 years after</i>
those first recordings

532
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,804
SPEAKER_04: <i>Carlos keeps working with images</i>
coming from football events.

533
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:46,161
SPEAKER_04: - Was my exit okay?
- It was fine.

534
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,965
SPEAKER_04: <i>Cut.</i>

535
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,969
SPEAKER_04: <i>Roll camera, roll sound.</i>

536
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:56,139
SPEAKER_04: - Do I have to clap again?
- <i>Yes, please.</i>

537
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:58,474
SPEAKER_04: - <i>Ready?</i>
- Yes.

538
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:03,411
SPEAKER_04: <i>When I started this movie, I was trying to</i>
find out if my mother was pretending or not.

539
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,215
SPEAKER_04: <i>If she had really turned mute,</i>
if she was really dying.

540
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:10,753
SPEAKER_04: <i>Neither my father nor other relatives</i>
or close friends believed her

01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:14,222
SPEAKER_04: <i>nor the doctors nor even</i>
the religious people.

542
01:03:14,322 --> 01:03:16,893
SPEAKER_04: <i>But, in a similar way to</i>
what many experienced

543
01:03:16,925 --> 01:03:19,762
SPEAKER_04: <i>when analyzing the images of the national </i>
Football championship final game

544
01:03:19,961 --> 01:03:22,532
SPEAKER_04: <i>there may be no difference</i>
between someone who suffers

545
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,500
SPEAKER_04: <i>and someone who</i>
pretends to suffer.

546
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:32,541
SPEAKER_04: <i>So, Carlos points out that</i>
it's useless to judge an image

547
01:03:32,574 --> 01:03:35,411
SPEAKER_04: <i>wanting to discern what's</i>
real in it and what’s not.

548
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:40,081
SPEAKER_04: <i>For him, images are jus not a good</i>
place to look for the truth.

549
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:45,554
SPEAKER_04: <i>Then, from the projects of</i>
Thomas Alva Edison, Rafael Reyes

550
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,625
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the recent images that</i>
dramatize deaths and violent events

551
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,893
SPEAKER_04: <i>perhaps it would be</i>
better to ask ourselves:

552
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,063
SPEAKER_04: <i>What effects do these</i>
images have on the living?

553
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:59,534
SPEAKER_04: <i>Do they have any participation</i>
in the events they represent?

554
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,211
SPEAKER_04: <i>For example these women.</i>

555
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:17,847
SPEAKER_04: <i>All three are actresses</i>

556
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,382
SPEAKER_04: <i>who pose as if they had lost</i>
a family member in the war

557
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,251
SPEAKER_04: <i>and were claiming for them.</i>

558
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,494
SPEAKER_04: …or something like that.

559
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:36,798
SPEAKER_05: They told me not to worry,
that nobody would find out.

560
01:05:37,365 --> 01:05:40,402
SPEAKER_05: So I believed them and
sold them the corpses.

561
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:45,407
SPEAKER_05: I found out later what they
were going to do with them.

562
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,443
SPEAKER_05: That they would disguise them...

563
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:54,750
SPEAKER_05: …and leave them on the mountains
as if they would have died in combat.

564
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,855
SPEAKER_05: I kept silence until they were
declared as "false positives".

565
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:31,853
SPEAKER_04: <i>In a similar way to what happened with</i>
the photographs of February 10th

566
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:35,623
SPEAKER_04: <i>what would be properly considered as</i>

the attempt and death of a political leader.

568
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:46,369
SPEAKER_04: <i>On October 15th, 1914, a few</i>
blocks from the Capitol

01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,971
SPEAKER_04: <i>the popular military</i>
hero Rafael Uribe Uribe

SPEAKER_04: <i>received a mortal blow with an ax</i>
on the right side of his head.

571
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:56,846
SPEAKER_04: <i>The politician was immediately transferred</i>
to a house in the center of the city

572
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:59,648
SPEAKER_04: <i>where he agonized for </i>
14 hours and finally died.

573
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:08,456
SPEAKER_04: <i>It’s told that hundreds of his followers</i>
walked all the way back to the Capitol

574
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:10,760
SPEAKER_04: <i>and with a white handkerchief </i>
in their hands

575
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:13,461
SPEAKER_04: <i>tried to pick up of the ground</i>
the blood of the politician.

576
01:07:14,295 --> 01:07:18,233
SPEAKER_04: <i>That same afternoon, while</i>
Rafael Uribe Uribe still lived

577

SPEAKER_04: <i>a few meters from the house where he was,</i>
the Italian brothers Di Doménico

SPEAKER_04: <i>who later would be recognized as</i>
"the fathers of Colombian Cinema"

579
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:32,815
SPEAKER_04: <i>began with urgency the filming of the</i>
first film of the country, entitled:

580
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,786
SPEAKER_04: <i>"The drama of October 15th",</i>
in which this murder was recreated.

581
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:40,588
SPEAKER_04: <i>Only one shot from the</i>
film is preserved.

582
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:45,494
SPEAKER_04: <i>These images are from the same</i>
date but made with other cameras.

583
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:49,364
SPEAKER_04: <i>However, due to the great</i>
controversy caused by the film

SPEAKER_04: <i>extensive descriptions of their images</i>
can be found in newspapers of the time.

585
01:07:58,273 --> 01:08:01,911
SPEAKER_04: <i>For example, we know that the</i>
film started with a fade

586
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,246
SPEAKER_04: <i>that slowly showed a</i>
portrait of the soldier.

587
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:09,318
SPEAKER_04: <i>After almost a minute in which the</i>
image was still on the screen

588
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:14,657
SPEAKER_04: <i>followed a scene that recreated the last</i>
moments of agony and death of the politician.

589
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:18,828
SPEAKER_04: <i>We also know that the film</i>
could never be fully projected.

590
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,863
SPEAKER_04: <i>Despite the good intentions</i>
of the Di Doménico brothers,

591
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:24,800
SPEAKER_04: <i>the audience couldn't bear to see</i>
the images of the hero dying

592

SPEAKER_04: <i>nor could they bare seeing his assassins.</i>

593
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,939
SPEAKER_04: <i>The public opinion</i>
reacted radically

594
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,975
SPEAKER_04: <i>and pursued with the censorship</i>
and destruction of the film.

595
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,412
SPEAKER_04: <i>In their defense, the Italians,</i>

596
01:08:36,444 --> 01:08:40,015
SPEAKER_04: <i>who due to the public harassment</i>
could never make a film again

597
01:08:40,114 --> 01:08:44,653
SPEAKER_04: <i>argued in their favor referring to the</i>
images of Christ dying on the cross.

598

SPEAKER_04: <i>If the highest institutions such as museums</i>
and churches in all regions of the planet

599
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:55,663
SPEAKER_04: <i>allocate entire pavilions with the sole function</i>
of protecting the image of Christ dying

600
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,967
SPEAKER_04: <i>it is because Christ reincarnates</i>
in each one of those images.

601
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,537
SPEAKER_04: <i>To adore those images</i>
is to adore the Christ,

602
01:09:01,636 --> 01:09:04,672
SPEAKER_04: <i>those images create the</i>
world of Christianity.

603
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,011
SPEAKER_04: <i>Thus, the Italians thought</i>

604
01:09:10,011 --> 01:09:13,381
SPEAKER_04: <i>that a State is also the</i>
sum of all its images.

605
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:17,953
SPEAKER_04: <i>For the Di Doménico brothers, destroying</i>
the images of Rafael Uribe Uribe dying

606
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:22,158
SPEAKER_04: <i>was opting for a country incapable of</i>
imagining and thinking about their dead.

607
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:29,797
SPEAKER_04: <i>The first film of the Colombian Cinema,</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>the famous image of the woman</i>
holding the patriotic symbols.

610
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,577
SPEAKER_04: <i>I imagine the death</i>
of Rafael Uribe Uribe

611
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:45,547
SPEAKER_04: <i>with a coffin that crosses the streets, </i>

614
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:56,225
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the events that surrounded it, </i>
allow us to see from a new perspective,

615
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,929
SPEAKER_04: <i>the images made by Rafael Reyes </i>
and Thomas Alva Edison.

616
01:10:00,194 --> 01:10:03,332

on the truth of the images,

617
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,268
SPEAKER_04: <i>but on the reaction that </i>
the public has before them.

618

SPEAKER_04: <i>These events highlight that the staging</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>Rafael Reyes and Thomas Edison</i>

SPEAKER_04: <i>These images are celebrated</i>
and widely broadcasted.

SPEAKER_04: <i>On the contrary,</i>

622
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:23,851
SPEAKER_04: <i>the Di Doménico brothers recreated </i>
the death of a beloved political leader

623

SPEAKER_04: <i>and hurt the sensitivity of the national</i>
public, the images were destroyed.

624
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:32,293
SPEAKER_04: <i>This shows that the images</i>
collect a sensitivity.

625
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:34,829
SPEAKER_04: <i>A sensitivity that</i>
only becomes tolerable

country likes to receive from itself.

627
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,804
SPEAKER_04: <i>These events also reveal</i>
something even simpler:

628
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:45,341
SPEAKER_04: <i>the survival of certain</i>
images leads to sympathy

629

SPEAKER_04: <i>and intensifies the idea that there</i>
are deaths worthy of mourning

01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,844
SPEAKER_04: <i>I wonder if, with the purpose</i>
of telling about these crimes

651
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:27,548
SPEAKER_04: <i>the best way wouldn’t have been through</i>
images invoking the real victims

652
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:32,787
SPEAKER_04: <i>the bodies of the executed youths, the</i>
testimonies of the relatives, the witnesses

653
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,556
SPEAKER_04: <i>and the people who actually</i>
suffered it in life.

654
01:16:35,623 --> 01:16:39,560
SPEAKER_04: <i>However, I suspect that the same </i>
thing would happened

01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:43,364
SPEAKER_04: <i>as it did, when they were first broadcasted </i>
in television across the country.

656
01:16:43,497 --> 01:16:47,536
SPEAKER_04: <i>We would simply close our eyes</i>
to avoid feeling those deaths.

657
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:55,409
SPEAKER_04: <i>When the "false positives" were presented</i>
as victories of the National Army

658
01:16:55,476 --> 01:16:58,145
SPEAKER_04: <i>they were celebrated and widespread deaths.</i>

659

SPEAKER_04: <i>But when those same dead people were</i>
stripped of their insurgent disguise

660

SPEAKER_04: <i>and turned into state crimes</i>

661

SPEAKER_04: <i>they didn't become a scandalous image.</i>

662
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:11,893
SPEAKER_04: <i>There was something about the theater they</i>
represented, that the audience clung to.

663
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:16,163
SPEAKER_04: <i>Perhaps, this is what the</i>
"false positives" warn us from.

664
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:19,801
SPEAKER_04: <i>That much of the way we feel about</i>
