of hat that each condemned was wearing.

28
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,587
SPEAKER_05: <i>It’s worth quoting the whole fragment:</i>

29
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:46,491
SPEAKER_05: <i>"They were all wearing black:</i>
Salgar wore a straight wing cinnamon hat.

SPEAKER_05: <i>The reporter also collects</i>
a series of interviews.

38
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,630
SPEAKER_05: <i>the first round of shooting</i>
resounds from the rifles.

39
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,470
SPEAKER_05: <i>Afterwards, a group of doctors approaches</i>

40
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,305
SPEAKER_05: <i>and certify that the condemned</i>
are still breathing,

41
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:35,774
SPEAKER_05: <i>and give the order for</i>
a second shooting,

57
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:56,389
SPEAKER_05: <i>Reyes thought that, just like the people</i>
who witnessed the shooting in person did,

58
00:05:56,588 --> 00:06:01,728
SPEAKER_05: <i>everyone who saw those photos</i>
would immediately support his idea.

SPEAKER_05: <i>about its first images.</i>

74
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,911
SPEAKER_05: <i>But as it's being said:</i>

75
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,580
SPEAKER_05: <i>To talk about Colombia</i>
we have to talk about war.

76
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:39,251
SPEAKER_05: <i>And to talk about war we need to talk about</i>
armies, about deaths, about cemeteries.

169
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,961
SPEAKER_05: <i>That’s me.</i>
