118
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:18,250
SPEAKER_13: There’s a line dividing the brain
into a left and a right hemisphere.

119
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:24,023
SPEAKER_13: Usually, in most people,
the left hemisphere

120
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:26,991
SPEAKER_13: dominates language.

121
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:32,464
SPEAKER_13: Language works in two important parts.
One part is in the temporal lobe.

122
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:39,038
SPEAKER_13: The one responsible for perception
and comprehension of any language.

123
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,440
SPEAKER_13: And the other one in the frontal lobe

124
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,544
SPEAKER_13: that’s directly responsible
for performing words.

125
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:52,551
SPEAKER_13: So that words can coordinate a coherent
answer according to the understood question.

126
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:56,054
SPEAKER_13: A coherent and adequate answer.

127
00:15:56,154 --> 00:16:01,460
SPEAKER_13: In your case, we’re hoping that you
understand the things we’re asking you.

128
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,895
SPEAKER_13: And in case you would
have any difficulties,

129
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:08,767
SPEAKER_13: we would find some structural injury
in this part that could be either a tumor

130
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,172
SPEAKER_13: or a scar of some cerebral stroke
that you might have had.

131
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:18,744
SPEAKER_13: No injury, no tumor.
Analyzing the neurological exam

132
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:24,482
SPEAKER_13: and this last generation
exam, we can conclude

133
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,754
SPEAKER_13: that Aracellys brain is completely normal.

134
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:14,932
SPEAKER_13: <i><font color='#f3cf1f'>- Ok. What's your name?</font></i>
<i><font color='#f3cf1f'>- Gustavo Rojas.</font></i>

535
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,969
SPEAKER_13: <i>Roll camera, roll sound.</i>

536
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:56,139
SPEAKER_13: - Do I have to clap again?
- <i>Yes, please.</i>

537
01:02:57,172 --> 01:02:58,474
SPEAKER_13: - <i>Ready?</i>
- Yes.
