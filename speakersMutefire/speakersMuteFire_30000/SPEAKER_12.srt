408
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:52,909
SPEAKER_12: We thank the Lord because...

409
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,246
SPEAKER_12: He has given us...

410
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:02,585
SPEAKER_12: an exact and clear message...

411
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:09,492
SPEAKER_12: and we have understood that message.

412
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,929
SPEAKER_12: It's not that we have a screw loose.

413
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:20,936
SPEAKER_12: It’s not that we’re crazy,
or that we’re less than you.

414
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,641
SPEAKER_12: It's not that.

415
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:30,514
SPEAKER_12: It’s just that we accepted
to walk with Jesus Christ.

416
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,952
SPEAKER_12: That’s the difference between you and us.

417
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:39,121
SPEAKER_12: That’s why, even with fear

418
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,628
SPEAKER_12: we’re here in front of the presence of God

419
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:48,898
SPEAKER_12: and maybe you, my friend, will say:

420
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:52,101
SPEAKER_12: The evangelics again...

421
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:55,438
SPEAKER_12: Making noise again...

422
00:52:56,273 --> 00:53:01,677
SPEAKER_12: Those people who come here just to sing...

423
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,880
SPEAKER_12: who just…
