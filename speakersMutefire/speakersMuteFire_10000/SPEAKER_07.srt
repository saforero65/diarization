439
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,851
SPEAKER_07: The strange thing was that I didn’t
notice her as worried as I was.

440
00:55:56,152 --> 00:56:00,389
SPEAKER_07: If I wake up mute I would
probably go crazy.

441
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:04,460
SPEAKER_07: I noticed it was an attitude
that she was assuming.

442
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:08,063
SPEAKER_07: I could never knew if was just
in front of me or everyone

443
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:09,565
SPEAKER_07: or facing life.

444
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,235
SPEAKER_07: Maybe she was punishing us all.

445
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:15,871
SPEAKER_07: But then she stopped speaking.

446
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,876
SPEAKER_07: I don’t think she can’t speak,
I think that she has decided not to speak.

447
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,980
SPEAKER_07: And I think it’s a voluntary decision.

448
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:28,650
SPEAKER_07: I thought, however, that it
could be a medical issue.

449
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,222
SPEAKER_07: We took her to the doctor

450
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:37,626
SPEAKER_07: I talked to Héctor, to César 
and to other people.

451
00:56:38,193 --> 00:56:40,295
SPEAKER_07: To everyone I thought could know.

452
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,632
SPEAKER_07: They all came to the
same conclusion:

453
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,336
SPEAKER_07: Aracelly's problem
is inexplicable.

454
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:53,041
SPEAKER_07: It’s not physiological, and it
doesn’t seem psychological either.

455
00:56:53,342 --> 00:56:57,447
SPEAKER_07: Always, always, always, I think
that she always understands us.

456
00:56:57,646 --> 00:57:00,849
SPEAKER_07: She hasn't lost the
capacity of understanding

457
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:04,820
SPEAKER_07: nor has she lost any
other kind of routines.

458
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,724
SPEAKER_07: She reads, she walks, she thinks,

459
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:11,661
SPEAKER_07: she insinuates, she takes initiatives.

460
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:16,266
SPEAKER_07: I think that she is taking somehow revenge.

461
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:21,237
SPEAKER_07: And I think that, somehow, what she’s pretending
is to make life unbearable to everyone.

462
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,873
SPEAKER_07: If that’s the case, she
should have said it,

463
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:27,242
SPEAKER_07: and it would have been better

464
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,746
SPEAKER_07: that we would just
have ended everything.

465
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,614
SPEAKER_07: I think that families begin

466
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:38,253
SPEAKER_07: and families dissolve, families
should not self-destruct.

467
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:42,458
SPEAKER_07: I think we never talked enough about love.

468
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,628
SPEAKER_07: Because if we had talked
enough about love

469
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,896
SPEAKER_07: we would have understood
it from the beginning.

470
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:53,135
SPEAKER_07: Love is born, it grows and it
dies like everything in nature.

471
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:59,675
SPEAKER_07: I believe that the academic attitude is not
only repeating texts in the universities

472
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:03,545
SPEAKER_07: but to live academically,
and that we have lacked.
