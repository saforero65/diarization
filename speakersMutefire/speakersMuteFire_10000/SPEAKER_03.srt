1
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:45,145
SPEAKER_03: I had been in the army for three years,
until I got kicked out...

2
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:51,350
SPEAKER_03: because there were some corpses
that had to be buried.

3
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:55,789
SPEAKER_03: My lieutenant gave me
the order to bury them.

4
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,029
SPEAKER_03: But I didn’t. Instead I sold them
to some people who approached me.

5
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:06,733
SPEAKER_03: They wanted me to sell them.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,602
SPEAKER_03: That they would use them for a play...

7
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,406
SPEAKER_03: or something like that.

8
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,944
SPEAKER_03: They told me not to worry,
that nobody would find out.

9
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,748
SPEAKER_03: So I believed them and
I sold them the corpses.

10
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:27,620
SPEAKER_03: I found out later what they
were really going to do with them.

11
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,924
SPEAKER_03: They would disguise them

12
00:01:31,356 --> 00:01:36,596
SPEAKER_03: and leave them in the mountains as
if they would have died in combat.

13
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:41,900
SPEAKER_03: I kept silence until they were
declared as "false positives".

14
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:54,980
SPEAKER_03: MUTE FIRE

15
00:01:55,981 --> 00:02:01,688
SPEAKER_03: On February 10th 1906, four men
tried to murder the president of Colombia.

16
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:08,794
SPEAKER_03: The staging of that event, was the
beginning of cinema in the country.

559
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:36,798
SPEAKER_03: They told me not to worry,
that nobody would find out.

560
01:05:37,365 --> 01:05:40,402
SPEAKER_03: So I believed them and
sold them the corpses.

561
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:45,407
SPEAKER_03: I found out later what they
were going to do with them.

562
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,443
SPEAKER_03: That they would disguise them...

563
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:54,750
SPEAKER_03: …and leave them on the mountains
as if they would have died in combat.

564
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,855
SPEAKER_03: I kept silence until they were
declared as "false positives".

697
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:13,073
SPEAKER_03: Because I stopped competing. I've been
the winner for eight years now.

698
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:16,845
SPEAKER_03: <i>- You stopped competing?</i>
- Yes.

699
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:21,716
SPEAKER_03: <i>- We wish you good luck for tomorrow.</i>
- Thank you.

700
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,112
SPEAKER_03: <i>Federico.</i>

701
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,618
SPEAKER_03: <i>Federico...</i>
