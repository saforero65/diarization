75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,009
SPEAKER_04: Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,110
SPEAKER_04: It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120

SPEAKER_01: What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_01: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330

SPEAKER_03: What do you mean?

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
SPEAKER_28: You bet your property.
It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,110
SPEAKER_28: You don't have a roof tile to your name.

122
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,090
SPEAKER_28: What is it?

123
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,620

124
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,149

125
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,379

126
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,950
SPEAKER_01: for leaving you homeless.

130
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,330
SPEAKER_03: The game's not over yet!

131
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,710

What would you wager?

133
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,809
SPEAKER_01: If you're unhappy, talk to Mr. Xie.

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_01: This can't be happening!

135
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,950
SPEAKER_13: What are you doing?

136
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,110
SPEAKER_13: It's not over yet!

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_08: Sit down.

138
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,919
SPEAKER_13: - Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_08: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

140
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,769

141

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_08: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

145
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,120

152
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,620
SPEAKER_04: Fugui...

153
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,960
SPEAKER_04: I just wanted to tell you...

154
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,360
SPEAKER_04: I've realized...

155
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,340
SPEAKER_04: you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,600
SPEAKER_04: I'm taking Fengxia with me.

157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,659
SPEAKER_04: If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
SPEAKER_04: I won't let him be like you.

159
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,179
SPEAKER_03: Master Fugui, I'll take you.

160
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,860
SPEAKER_14: - What are you doing?
- Master Fugui.

161
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,710
SPEAKER_11: I have nothing left.

162
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,220
SPEAKER_11: 63, 73, 83...

163
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,400
SPEAKER_16: Mr. Xu, any mistakes?

164
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,269
SPEAKER_30: No, Fugui's signature is on each one.

165
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:42,950
SPEAKER_30: Long'er, is our Xu family home...

166
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,650
SPEAKER_30: enough to settle Fugui's debt?

167
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,160
SPEAKER_30: Good.

168
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,829
SPEAKER_30: A gambling debt's a debt,
and debts must be paid.

169
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,170
SPEAKER_30: Everyone's here today.

170
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:02,640
SPEAKER_30: So let's do what must be done.

171
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,500
SPEAKER_21: The Xu family home...

172
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,099
SPEAKER_21: goes to Long'er.

173
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,640
SPEAKER_21: And the debt is hereby settled.

174
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,450
SPEAKER_21: Both sides must sign.

175
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,740
SPEAKER_21: I thought I'd live my final days here.

176
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,250
SPEAKER_21: Fugui.

177
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,380
SPEAKER_21: Turtle spawn! I'll kill him!

178
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,390
SPEAKER_21: I'll cut him into pieces! I'll clobber him!

179
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,329
SPEAKER_21: I'll never forgive you!

180
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,690
SPEAKER_21: I'll never forgive you!

181
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:03,359
SPEAKER_21: I want him dead!

182
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,400
SPEAKER_21: Sir!

183
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,660
SPEAKER_01: It's valuable. Don't scratch it. Take it slowly.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_01: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_01: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_01: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_01: I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_01: Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_01: Want me to help you?

190
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,480
SPEAKER_11: Needles and threads for sale!

191
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,549
SPEAKER_04: Granny!

192
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,049
SPEAKER_04: Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,450
SPEAKER_04: Jiazhen.

194
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,549
SPEAKER_04: Come look at your son.

195
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,990
SPEAKER_06: He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_03: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_03: What's his name?

198
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,789
SPEAKER_04: "Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,730
SPEAKER_04: He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,329
SPEAKER_04: Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,759
SPEAKER_04: Me.

202
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,509
SPEAKER_04: Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,509
SPEAKER_04: I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
SPEAKER_04: I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,450
SPEAKER_04: Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,619
SPEAKER_04: I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_04: Youqing, excellent.

208
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,160
SPEAKER_04: Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_18: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_18: But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
SPEAKER_04: Let's put the past behind us...

212
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,009
SPEAKER_04: and live peacefully.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_18: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_18: It's crowded with all of us here.

215
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,789
SPEAKER_04: I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_03: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_18: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

218
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,569
SPEAKER_04: Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,279
SPEAKER_04: but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,140
SPEAKER_04: We'll work something out.

221
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
SPEAKER_04: I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_30: Life won't be easy.

223
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,579
SPEAKER_04: Don't say that.

224
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,509
SPEAKER_04: All I ask is a quiet life together.

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_01: A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_01: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_03: Just call me Fugui.

228
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,769
SPEAKER_01: This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,369
SPEAKER_01: Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_01: Great at any price.

231
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,009
SPEAKER_01: I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,519
SPEAKER_01: Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,990
SPEAKER_01: I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_03: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_03: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_03: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_03: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_03: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_03: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_01: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_01: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

242
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,930
SPEAKER_23: I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,190
SPEAKER_01: Earn your money yourself.

244
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,529
SPEAKER_01: Put together a troupe.

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
SPEAKER_01: They are fabulous.

246
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,250
SPEAKER_01: My heart is full of sorrow

247
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,339
SPEAKER_01: It's that hateful bandit, Jiang

248
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,619
SPEAKER_01: I'm lucky to be alive

249
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,670
SPEAKER_14: Me and my lover want more time

250
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:43,339
SPEAKER_14: To frolic on our great big bed

251
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,880
SPEAKER_14: Come out!

252
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,289
SPEAKER_00: Come on! Get a move on!

253
00:28:56,589 --> 00:29:00,589
SPEAKER_00: 1949: Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army
is losing the civil war.

254
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,529
SPEAKER_00: The Communists under Mao Zedong
are poised to take over China.

255
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,670
SPEAKER_00: So we're fighting the Communists.

256
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,769
SPEAKER_19: Might never go home again.

257
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,220
SPEAKER_19: What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,890
SPEAKER_19: Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,130
SPEAKER_19: The Nationalists will shoot you.

260
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,470
SPEAKER_20: Besides...

261
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,859
SPEAKER_20: troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,569
SPEAKER_20: If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
SPEAKER_20: But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,410
SPEAKER_20: Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,259
SPEAKER_20: As for me...

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,599
SPEAKER_20: if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,859
SPEAKER_20: Chunsheng, you really are mad.

268
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:43,619
SPEAKER_19: I'd die happy if I could drive.

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_18: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_18: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

271
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,269
SPEAKER_11: One, two, three. One, two, three.

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_08: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_08: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_08: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_08: Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_03: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_03: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_20: What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_18: What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,549
SPEAKER_20: The wounded.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_20: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_20: No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
SPEAKER_20: No one's left.

284
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,119
SPEAKER_20: Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_08: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170
SPEAKER_08: Take this.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_03: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_18: Which corpses?

289
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,220
SPEAKER_16: The wounded who froze to death.

290
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,420
SPEAKER_20: Put it on. We must survive.

291
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,089
SPEAKER_19: Lao Quan, have a drink.

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_25: It really is booze!

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_20: Was it from some dead officer?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_18: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_18: You've looked after us.

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_20: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_20: Besides, we're from the same town.

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_20: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_20: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_25: What happened? No one's left?

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,589
SPEAKER_16: They've all run off.

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
SPEAKER_16: How could that be?

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_20: The Reds must be on the attack.

304
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,130
SPEAKER_19: What?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
SPEAKER_19: - Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

306
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,599
SPEAKER_25: Home!

307
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,769
SPEAKER_21: Home?

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
SPEAKER_21: Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_20: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_20: and you'll be shot.

311
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,550
SPEAKER_21: Better to wait and become a POW.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_20: The Reds send POWs home.

313
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,460
SPEAKER_16: So, no running?

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_20: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_20: You want to go home, don't run.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_03: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_03: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_20: How?

319
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,940
SPEAKER_19: This will do the trick?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_20: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_20: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_20: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_20: Just put those hands up.

324
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,940
SPEAKER_19: - The attack hasn't started.
- Let's put them down.

325
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,059
SPEAKER_11: Chunsheng!

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_18: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_18: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_18: we've got to make it back alive.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_03: And live a good life.

330
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,269
SPEAKER_26: Lao Quan! They're shooting!

331
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,849
SPEAKER_21: Where did you find this coat?

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_03: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_20: The coat's from my brother's unit.

334
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,360
SPEAKER_08: - What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

335
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,730
SPEAKER_26: What's your brother look like?

336
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,269
SPEAKER_26: Just like me.

337
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,019
SPEAKER_26: Lao Quan!

338
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:36,420
SPEAKER_13: The enemy's secret weapon

339
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:42,130
SPEAKER_13: wounded me

340
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:50,599
SPEAKER_13: I gather my troops

341
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:04,210
SPEAKER_13: and we run for our lives

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_03: Fengxia!

343
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,190
SPEAKER_23: It's your daddy.

344
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,440
SPEAKER_23: What are you doing?

345
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,769
SPEAKER_23: Where's mommy?

346
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,519
SPEAKER_23: I'm home.

347
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,550
SPEAKER_23: Home.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_18: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_18: The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_03: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_03: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

352
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,920
SPEAKER_04: She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,849
SPEAKER_04: kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,570
SPEAKER_04: You should have written.

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_18: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_18: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_03: I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_18: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_18: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_18: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

361
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,659
SPEAKER_04: and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,489
SPEAKER_04: I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,929
SPEAKER_04: Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,519
SPEAKER_04: The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,789
SPEAKER_04: It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,199
SPEAKER_04: They never get...

367
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,869
SPEAKER_04: a good night's sleep.

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_03: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_18: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_18: She can't even say "Daddy."

371
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,449
SPEAKER_04: In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,019
SPEAKER_04: For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,260
SPEAKER_04: No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,849
SPEAKER_04: When the fever came down...

375
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,059
SPEAKER_04: she'd lost her voice.

376
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,460
SPEAKER_04: You're here.

377
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,000
SPEAKER_03: Fugui's back.

378
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:52,429
SPEAKER_03: This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

379
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,400
SPEAKER_06: So you're our leading cadre.

380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_09: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_09: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_09: Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,119
SPEAKER_09: He has served in the Liberation Army?

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_09: You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_03: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_09: That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_09: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_18: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_18: We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_09: Fugui, you're back just in time...

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_09: to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,579
SPEAKER_09: Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,210
SPEAKER_09: What did Long'er do?

394
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:47,449
SPEAKER_04: Because of the family home,
he's been sentenced a landlord.

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_09: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_09: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_09: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_09: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_09: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_18: He burnt it?

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_07: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_07: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_07: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

404
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,150
SPEAKER_04: Counterrevolutionary timber.

405
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,429
SPEAKER_09: Of course. You're you, he's him.

406
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,800
SPEAKER_00: Execute the revolutionary despot, Long'er!

407
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:39,800
SPEAKER_00: To the execution ground!

408
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,099
SPEAKER_00: We will crush the counterrevolution!

409
00:48:43,179 --> 00:48:46,110
SPEAKER_00: Crush the counterrevolution!

410
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:48,809
SPEAKER_00: Down with the counterrevolutionaries!

411
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,090
SPEAKER_00: Long live the Communist Party!

412
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,059
SPEAKER_00: Long live the People's Government!

413
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,829
SPEAKER_00: Long live Chairman Mao!
Down with the counterrevolutionaries!

414
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:10,329
SPEAKER_00: Build a new China!

415
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,500
SPEAKER_04: What's wrong?

416
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
SPEAKER_04: Why are your pants wet?

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_03: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_03: They shot him.

419
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,510
SPEAKER_29: They shot Long'er?

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_03: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_03: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_03: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_03: that'd have been me.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_18: What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_03: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_03: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

427
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,730
SPEAKER_04: Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,070
SPEAKER_04: Ordinary townspeople.

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_03: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_03: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_04: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_03: Better dry it out fast.

433
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,699
SPEAKER_04: Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,530
SPEAKER_04: Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,800
SPEAKER_04: Of course.

436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,969
SPEAKER_04: Poor townspeople.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_04: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,579
SPEAKER_04: Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,050
SPEAKER_04: I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,719
SPEAKER_04: Good idea!

441
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,400
SPEAKER_27: The 1950s

442
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,840
SPEAKER_27: 1958: Mao Zedong launches
the "Great Leap Forward."

443
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:08,710
SPEAKER_27: Steel production is now targeted
at 10.7 million tonnes per year.

444
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,309
SPEAKER_27: Every household donates its iron utensils.

445
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:32,010
SPEAKER_27: Take a break.

446
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,639
SPEAKER_29: Tired?

447
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,280
SPEAKER_29: Fugui!

448
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,989
SPEAKER_29: Our family's turn to donate iron.

449
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:49,050
SPEAKER_29: It's ready.

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,409
SPEAKER_09: It's all here?

451
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,760
SPEAKER_09: Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,619
SPEAKER_09: To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_09: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_09: We'll take these.

455
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:06,710
SPEAKER_06: If you take all our pots away,
how will we cook?

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_09: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_09: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_09: When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_09: just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_09: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_09: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_09: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_09: But that's wood.

464
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,369
SPEAKER_10: There's metal on it.

465
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,170
SPEAKER_02: And here are pins.

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_18: It can't be worth much.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_09: We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
SPEAKER_09: It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_09: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_09: So let's get that metal.

471
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:12,570
SPEAKER_04: The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:15,900
SPEAKER_04: You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,510
SPEAKER_04: and after that...

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_18: they captured two mountains a day.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_07: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_09: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_09: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_03: You can leave those.

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_03: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_03: We're off to the next house.

481
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:46,329
SPEAKER_02: We are not going to liberate Taiwan?

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_09: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

483
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,539
SPEAKER_11: Take that!

484
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,659
SPEAKER_11: - Enough?
- No!

485
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,530
SPEAKER_11: Enough?

486
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,690
SPEAKER_11: Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

487
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:58,269
SPEAKER_23: Big ambition for a little kid.

488
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,539
SPEAKER_23: It's more than enough.

489
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,570
SPEAKER_23: So gobble away. Help yourself to sauces.

490
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,010
SPEAKER_23: Youqing, I'll help you stir that up.

491
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:15,820
SPEAKER_23: What a big appetite!

492
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,329
SPEAKER_23: And so much chili sauce!

493
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,900
SPEAKER_29: That's a big bowl, Youqing.

494
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:32,409
SPEAKER_29: Give it to us if you can't finish.

495
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:07,630
SPEAKER_29: What the hell are you doing?

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_08: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_08: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_08: What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_08: What is this?

500
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,320
SPEAKER_11: Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_25: This is too much.

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_08: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_08: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_18: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_08: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_08: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_08: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_08: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_08: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_08: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_08: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_08: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
SPEAKER_08: I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,969
SPEAKER_13: - Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:17,269
SPEAKER_13: - Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,039
SPEAKER_13: - I'm telling you to go!
- No!

517
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:23,280
SPEAKER_13: You won't go?

518
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:28,780
SPEAKER_11: Don't hit him!

519
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,320
SPEAKER_13: Leave him alone! I'll kill him!

520
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,329
SPEAKER_13: Enough!

521
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,989
SPEAKER_13: How could you?

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_03: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

523
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:49,469
SPEAKER_04: That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,239
SPEAKER_04: I tried to stop you.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_03: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_03: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_03: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_03: You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_03: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_03: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_03: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_03: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_25: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_25: Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_04: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610
SPEAKER_04: You, looking after us! After all these years.

537
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,380
SPEAKER_04: What do you know?

538
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,150
SPEAKER_04: Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,869
SPEAKER_04: Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,860
SPEAKER_04: I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840
SPEAKER_04: Have I ever complained?

542
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,780
SPEAKER_04: Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,420
SPEAKER_04: Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
SPEAKER_03: Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,909
SPEAKER_03: Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,599
SPEAKER_03: come see the show.

547
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_03: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909
SPEAKER_03: He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:25,420
SPEAKER_03: and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
SPEAKER_03: I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,139
SPEAKER_03: Far away, we flee with haste

552
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,710
SPEAKER_03: Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

553
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:36,820
SPEAKER_14: He wouldn't come.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_26: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_26: Say I want him to.

556
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,199
SPEAKER_29: Youqing, daddy wants you to see the show.

557
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,500
SPEAKER_04: Well?

558
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,300
SPEAKER_04: I'm not going!

559
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,750
SPEAKER_04: Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,110
SPEAKER_04: Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,409
SPEAKER_04: Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,599
SPEAKER_04: Take him tea full of vinegar.

563
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,869
SPEAKER_04: That will teach him.

564
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:24,429
SPEAKER_11: Enough?

565
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,469
SPEAKER_04: Okay, we'll really get him.

566
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:36,710
SPEAKER_02: Should we add chili?

567
01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:40,820
SPEAKER_02: Good, it'll be hot and sour soup.

568
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:49,650
SPEAKER_29: Your boy's on his way with a bowl of tea.

569
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,360
SPEAKER_26: Youqing, is that tea for me?

570
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,329
SPEAKER_26: Good boy, bring it over here.

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_18: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_18: How do you like my singing?

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_18: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

574
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:43,340
SPEAKER_00: He's put in chili!

575
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,690
SPEAKER_09: We've smelted our steel...

576
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,989
SPEAKER_09: and reached our production target.

577
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:54,500
SPEAKER_09: We're off to report the good news.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,219
SPEAKER_09: Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_09: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_09: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_09: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_03: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
SPEAKER_13: Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,500
SPEAKER_09: We've made enough steel
for three cannon balls.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_13: They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_09: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_09: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_09: and the last in the toilet!

589
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,880
SPEAKER_03: He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

590
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,539
SPEAKER_13: and we'll liberate Taiwan!

591
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,359
SPEAKER_26: Xia, Youqing, have some dumplings.

592
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,970
SPEAKER_04: Let them sleep. They'll eat later.

593
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,000
SPEAKER_02: Xu Youqing!

594
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:49,439
SPEAKER_02: What's up?

595
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:52,449
SPEAKER_02: The teacher wants us at school
smelting steel.

596
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,680
SPEAKER_29: The District Head's making an inspection.

597
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,840
SPEAKER_29: All right. You go on ahead.

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_03: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

599
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,920
SPEAKER_04: He's not going anywhere.
He hasn't slept in days.

600
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,390
SPEAKER_04: Leave him alone.

601
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,899
SPEAKER_04: - The District Chief is coming.
- So?

602
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,760
SPEAKER_04: A kid still has to sleep.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_18: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_18: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_18: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_18: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_18: You have to go smelt steel.

608
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,390
SPEAKER_00: Come on, get up.

609
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,159
SPEAKER_00: Your classmates are already on their way.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_18: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_18: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_18: Have 20. You should eat more.

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_03: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_03: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_03: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_03: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_03: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_03: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_03: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_03: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_03: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_03: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_03: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_03: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_03: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_03: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_03: The sheep will turn into an ox.

628
01:12:01,109 --> 01:12:02,539
SPEAKER_02: And after the ox?

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_03: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_03: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

631
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,670
SPEAKER_12: It's Fugui's son?

632
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,649
SPEAKER_12: District Chief arrived after dark.

633
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,079
SPEAKER_12: He backed up,
and his jeep knocked the wall down.

634
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:19,020
SPEAKER_12: Youqing was sleeping on the other side.

635
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,850
SPEAKER_12: When the wall collapsed...

636
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,159
SPEAKER_12: he didn't have a chance.

637
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:26,560
SPEAKER_12: The District Chief was hurt, too.

638
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,130
SPEAKER_12: He hadn't slept for three days.

639
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:58,420
SPEAKER_12: Fugui, listen to me.

640
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:02,430
SPEAKER_12: We have to try and bear it,
even in the worst of times.

641
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,439
SPEAKER_26: What's happened?

642
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,350
SPEAKER_26: Answer me!

643
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,460
SPEAKER_26: Daddy's here! Say something!

644
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:44,539
SPEAKER_13: Take the body away!

645
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:47,569
SPEAKER_26: We mustn't let his mother see.

646
01:14:55,819 --> 01:14:58,220
SPEAKER_26: Mommy's here! Youqing!

647
01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:02,510
SPEAKER_26: Youqing! What's going on?

648
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:08,920
SPEAKER_11: Let me see him!

649
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:31,680
SPEAKER_04: You never had the chance to eat
the dumplings I packed for you.

650
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:35,449
SPEAKER_04: Mommy's made you more...

651
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:39,449
SPEAKER_04: twenty this time.

652
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,880
SPEAKER_04: That should be enough.

653
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:46,289
SPEAKER_04: Once you've eaten...

654
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,489
SPEAKER_04: you can sleep...

655
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:51,590
SPEAKER_06: a nice, deep sleep.

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,739
SPEAKER_06: In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,640
SPEAKER_06: So sleep well now.

658
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:08,220
SPEAKER_06: Mommy will come see you every day.

659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,649
SPEAKER_06: Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_06: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_06: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_06: from making you go.

663
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,109
SPEAKER_05: It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_06: If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
SPEAKER_05: I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

666
01:17:51,489 --> 01:17:53,430
SPEAKER_05: Oh, my poor darling.

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_09: The District Chief has come.

668
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,989
SPEAKER_04: The one who ran over my son?

669
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:32,529
SPEAKER_04: What's he doing here?

670
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,859
SPEAKER_29: Tell him to leave. He killed my son.

671
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,670
SPEAKER_29: - He's already here.
- Tell him to go.

672
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,609
SPEAKER_30: It's me, Chunsheng.

673
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,159
SPEAKER_19: I meant to call...

674
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,930
SPEAKER_19: after I settled in.

675
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:07,930
SPEAKER_19: Fugui...

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,699
SPEAKER_19: how could it be your son?

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_03: You're the District Chief?

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_03: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_03: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

680
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,689
SPEAKER_03: I had only one son!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_03: And you killed him!

682
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,000
SPEAKER_13: You, behind the goddamn wheel!

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_09: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_09: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_09: How can I ever make it up?

686
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,489
SPEAKER_19: Take this for now.

687
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,520
SPEAKER_19: It's money.

688
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:07,520
SPEAKER_19: Tell me what else I can do.

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_06: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_06: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,100
SPEAKER_06: You killed him! Give him back to me!

692
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,970
SPEAKER_05: Go away!

693
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,640
SPEAKER_06: Remember, you owe us a life.

694
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,380
SPEAKER_06: You killed him. Remember that.

695
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,479
SPEAKER_06: You killed him.

696
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,319
SPEAKER_06: Go away! Now!

697
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,779
SPEAKER_05: District Chief, let's go.

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_07: I think you should go, Chief.

699
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:44,560
SPEAKER_08: Go away!

700
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,439
SPEAKER_08: All right.

701
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,340
SPEAKER_08: I'm going.

702
01:20:56,909 --> 01:20:58,539
SPEAKER_19: I owe you a life.

703
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,739
SPEAKER_19: I will remember.

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_08: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_08: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_08: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_08: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_08: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_08: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_08: Let her go!

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_08: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_08: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_08: No!

714
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:07,439
SPEAKER_10: The 1960s

715
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:15,619

716

717
01:22:18,029 --> 01:22:20,960
SPEAKER_10: and left no family unaffected.

718
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,710
SPEAKER_03: - You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_03: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

720
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,140
SPEAKER_03: Sit here.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
SPEAKER_03: You have to get rid of those puppets.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_07: Everyone knows about them.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_18: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_18: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_18: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_18: Put these old things to new use.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_07: Don't you see what they are?

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_07: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_07: Classic feudal types.

730
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,119
SPEAKER_09: Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,760
SPEAKER_09: "The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_09: Do as Chairman Mao says.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_03: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_07: Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,930
SPEAKER_07: Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_07: Fetch a brazier.

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_08: You can't keep them. Burn them!

738
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,609
SPEAKER_09: Fugui...

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_09: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_09: to get you a better job. What do you think?

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_18: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_18: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_18: We'll discuss it later.

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_09: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

745
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,390
SPEAKER_04: I'll tell you about him.

746
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,100
SPEAKER_04: Let's not let her in on it for now.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_07: I've found just the man for her.

748
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:30,909

SPEAKER_07: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_03: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_03: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_03: He's also got a handicap...

754
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,170

755
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,329
SPEAKER_04: How lame? Can he walk?

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_07: Yes, and run if he has to.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_18: He can run?

758
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:00,949
SPEAKER_04: Was he born a cripple?

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
SPEAKER_07: No, it was an accident at work.

760
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,979
SPEAKER_07: He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_07: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_07: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_04: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

764
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,449
SPEAKER_09: Comrade Wan Erxi's here.

765
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,420
SPEAKER_09: Comrade Wan Erxi.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,989
SPEAKER_09: Fengxia's mom and dad.

767
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:46,350
SPEAKER_04: Come inside.

768
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,140
SPEAKER_04: Have something to drink.

769
01:27:03,579 --> 01:27:05,770
SPEAKER_04: Quotations from Chairman Mao

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,289
SPEAKER_09: Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_09: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_09: Solid working class stock.

773
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,890
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.

774
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,520
SPEAKER_04: A good family.

775
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,100
SPEAKER_04: The Liberation Army
gave me that certificate.

776
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,909
SPEAKER_28: Good.

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
SPEAKER_07: Where's Fengxia?

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,869
SPEAKER_16: Comrade Wan Erxi.

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_07: Comrade Fengxia.

780
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,920
SPEAKER_19: I'll be going.

781
01:28:20,989 --> 01:28:23,220
SPEAKER_04: Have something to eat first. Lunch is ready.

782
01:28:23,289 --> 01:28:24,659
SPEAKER_04: No, thanks.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_03: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_03: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_03: No, really.

786
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:36,689
SPEAKER_07: Let's go.

787
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,420
SPEAKER_04: What do you think?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_18: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_18: I approve.

790
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,020
SPEAKER_04: Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?

791
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,760
SPEAKER_04: He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_18: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_18: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

794
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,250
SPEAKER_04: I think she likes him.

795
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,779
SPEAKER_04: It's different from before. Look.

796
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,460
SPEAKER_04: Go ask Mr. Niu...

797
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:41,300
SPEAKER_04: what the boy thinks.

798
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,369
SPEAKER_04: How's this for Fengxia?

799
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:00,890
SPEAKER_04: Comrade, could I look at that one?

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_25: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_25: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_25: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_03: From where?

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_25: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

805
01:30:16,609 --> 01:30:18,159
SPEAKER_04: You'd better hurry back.

806
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,569
SPEAKER_04: A cripple?

807
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:21,539
SPEAKER_04: Must be Wan Erxi!

808
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,310
SPEAKER_04: He doesn't like Fengxia,
so he tears the place down.

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_18: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_18: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

811
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:33,079
SPEAKER_04: We'd better hurry.

812
01:30:33,149 --> 01:30:35,180
SPEAKER_04: Don't forget your package!

813
01:31:06,489 --> 01:31:08,079
SPEAKER_19: Aren't you busy!

814
01:31:08,659 --> 01:31:10,680
SPEAKER_15: I brought some colleagues.

815
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,779
SPEAKER_15: We're fixing the place up.

816
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,960
SPEAKER_15: We replaced the roof tiles...

817
01:31:16,029 --> 01:31:18,159
SPEAKER_15: so it wouldn't leak anymore.

818
01:31:18,529 --> 01:31:21,369
SPEAKER_15: And we've painted Chairman Mao's portrait.

819
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:25,270
SPEAKER_15: Fengxia helped us.

820
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,510
SPEAKER_15: You're just in time. We've just finished.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_15: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

822
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,449
SPEAKER_16: We must be going.

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_26: Do stay! Come on inside.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_13: Erxi painted this.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_03: "The working class leads us all."

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_08: Erxi is good with his hands.

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_03: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

828
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:01,909
SPEAKER_29: I'll get some water so you can wash up.

829
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:04,810
SPEAKER_16: Thanks, we'll go to the factory bathhouse.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_25: You've gone to so much trouble.

831
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:14,779
SPEAKER_13: Please come again.

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489
SPEAKER_13: What do you think about Fengxia and me?

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_03: We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_04: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_04: Shall we set a date?

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_03: Anytime. You decide.

837
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,340
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's had a hard life.

838
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,109
SPEAKER_04: If you don't mind...

839
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,010
SPEAKER_04: let's make the wedding a real occasion.

840
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,920
SPEAKER_04: To make her happy.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399
SPEAKER_09: Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_03: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_03: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_03: Let's sing a song!

845
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:05,659
SPEAKER_03: Nothing compares
to the Party's benevolence

846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,229
SPEAKER_03: Chairman Mao is dearer
than father and mother

847
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:18,739
SPEAKER_03: There's nothing as good as socialism

848
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,609
SPEAKER_03: No ocean as deep as class feeling

849
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,680
SPEAKER_03: Maoist Thought
is revolution's treasure trove

850
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:34,630
SPEAKER_03: Whoever opposes it, we take as our enemy

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
SPEAKER_03: Come on, you can't cry today.

852
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:00,319
SPEAKER_04: They're all singing for Fengxia...

853
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,479
SPEAKER_04: and she can't even join in!

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_18: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

855
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,229
SPEAKER_26: Time for a photo!

856
01:35:18,869 --> 01:35:20,840
SPEAKER_26: Move aside! Stand still!

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_08: Hold your little Red Books.

858
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,180
SPEAKER_11: Clear a path! Ship sailing through!

859
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,250
SPEAKER_11: Let's get the whole family.

860
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:55,979
SPEAKER_11: The ship of revolution! Advance
through the storm with Chairman Mao!

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
SPEAKER_13: Time to wrap up.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_13: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

863
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:17,989
SPEAKER_16: Chairman Mao...

864
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:21,600
SPEAKER_16: Comrade Fengxia's mine now.

865
01:36:27,909 --> 01:36:30,140
SPEAKER_13: Come over here.

866
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:32,750
SPEAKER_13: Now, bow!

867
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,479
SPEAKER_19: Dad, Mom...

868
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,409
SPEAKER_15: I'm taking Fengxia.

869
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:40,649
SPEAKER_15: I'll look after her.

870
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,220
SPEAKER_11: Go on, don't be sad.

871
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:14,789
SPEAKER_11: You'll be back!

872
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,109
SPEAKER_28: Chunsheng.

873
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:45,880
SPEAKER_19: Congratulations on Fengxia's wedding.

874
01:37:46,289 --> 01:37:48,760
SPEAKER_19: - When did you get here?
- A while ago.

875
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:52,149
SPEAKER_19: But there were so many people,
I didn't come in.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_03: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_03: Jiazhen, make some tea.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_03: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_03: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

880
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,649
SPEAKER_04: Water's not boiled.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_03: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_03: Don't be like that.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_03: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_03: But here's boiled water.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_03: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_03: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_03: Can't we put this behind us?

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_04: If only Youqing had been here today.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
SPEAKER_19: I'll be going.

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_18: Don't go. The tea's ready.

891
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:07,270
SPEAKER_19: Never mind.

892
01:39:09,939 --> 01:39:12,739
SPEAKER_19: Jiazhen, I know you don't want to see me.

893
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,800
SPEAKER_19: I'll leave my gift here and be gone.

894
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:36,130
SPEAKER_04: Give it back to him.

895
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,630
SPEAKER_04: I don't want his gifts.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_03: But it's Chairman Mao.

897
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,279
SPEAKER_08: Dad! Mom!

898
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,470
SPEAKER_08: Come on in!

899
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,399
SPEAKER_29: Fengxia, you're back!

900
01:40:19,069 --> 01:40:20,340
SPEAKER_29: You cold?

901
01:40:25,909 --> 01:40:27,239
SPEAKER_29: I'm fine, really.

902
01:40:27,319 --> 01:40:29,720
SPEAKER_29: How are you feeling, Mom?

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_03: On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_03: Better when you come over.

905
01:40:33,989 --> 01:40:35,510
SPEAKER_06: Have you eaten?

906
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,409
SPEAKER_15: I'll make something.

907
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:40,220
SPEAKER_15: Lunch is all taken care of.

908
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:50,100
SPEAKER_03: Help me with the table.

909
01:40:59,109 --> 01:41:01,510
SPEAKER_06: You brought a bottle.

910
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:17,659
SPEAKER_15: Dad, Mom, we're having a baby.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_03: No wonder there's a bottle!

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,329
SPEAKER_03: Really?

913
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:28,000
SPEAKER_15: I just came from the hospital.
The doctor says it's due in autumn.

914
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:32,239
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's going to be a mother.

915
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:35,770
SPEAKER_29: Fengxia, you're going to be a mother.

916
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:38,680
SPEAKER_12: Cheers!

917
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,460
SPEAKER_04: Erxi, when you went to the hospital today...

918
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,560
SPEAKER_04: what did they say about Fengxia's health?

919
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:53,890
SPEAKER_15: That she's in terrific shape.

920
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,000
SPEAKER_04: Still, you can't be too careful.

921
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,829
SPEAKER_04: Your folks aren't around.

922
01:41:58,909 --> 01:42:02,069
SPEAKER_04: After the birth,
you'll stay with us for a while.

923
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:07,609
SPEAKER_04: Spend as much time as you can with her.

924
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:11,149
SPEAKER_04: When I was pregnant with Fengxia...

925
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,449
SPEAKER_04: her dad was never around.

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,119
SPEAKER_15: He was very busy?

927
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,680
SPEAKER_06: Very!

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_03: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_03: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_18: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_18: And will be better for your child.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_18: Erxi, drink up.

933
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,399
SPEAKER_29: Help yourself.

934
01:42:41,649 --> 01:42:43,579
SPEAKER_15: I had the photo framed.

935
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,260
SPEAKER_04: We haven't taken a photo in years.

936
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,920
SPEAKER_03: This is great.

937
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,529
SPEAKER_04: After the child is born...

938
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,399
SPEAKER_04: have a photo taken every year.

939
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,369
SPEAKER_04: We've no photos of Fengxia as a child.

940
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:09,569
SPEAKER_28: Okay.

941
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:13,109
SPEAKER_29: Fengxia, after the child is born...

942
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:16,239
SPEAKER_29: have a photo taken every year.

943
01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:24,050
SPEAKER_29: Dad, I saw Chunsheng yesterday.

944
01:43:25,989 --> 01:43:28,829
SPEAKER_15: He's been arrested as a capitalist.

945
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,829
SPEAKER_15: They held a public trial against him.

946
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,930
SPEAKER_15: We have to draw a line between us and him.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_03: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_03: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_03: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

950
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,430
SPEAKER_19: Fugui!

951
01:44:11,369 --> 01:44:12,770
SPEAKER_19: Who's there?

952
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,210
SPEAKER_19: Chunsheng.

953
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:16,640
SPEAKER_19: Who?

954
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,039
SPEAKER_30: Chunsheng.

955
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:24,779
SPEAKER_30: What do you want?

956
01:44:26,949 --> 01:44:28,850
SPEAKER_30: Come out for a second.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_18: Just say what you want.

958
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,819
SPEAKER_03: It'll just take a minute.

959
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:09,489
SPEAKER_19: Well?

960
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,329
SPEAKER_19: Fugui...

961
01:45:12,329 --> 01:45:15,060
SPEAKER_19: I've always felt terrible about Youqing.

962
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,300
SPEAKER_19: I've often tried to give you money.
You'd never accept it.

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
SPEAKER_03: It's all in this account. Take it.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_03: You came for this?

965
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,819
SPEAKER_19: Take this...

966
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,420
SPEAKER_19: and my heart will be at ease.

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_03: All my debts will have been paid.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_03: What do you mean?

969
01:45:47,529 --> 01:45:49,869
SPEAKER_19: Yesterday, my wife killed herself.

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_03: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_03: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_03: Have you seen her body?

974
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:02,340
SPEAKER_19: No.

975
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,979
SPEAKER_19: I just got an official notice.

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_03: You mustn't lose hope.

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_03: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_03: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_03: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_03: I don't want to live anymore!

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_25: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_25: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_25: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_25: Can't you see?

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_03: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_03: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_03: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_03: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_03: you've got to bear it!

990
01:47:11,619 --> 01:47:13,449
SPEAKER_19: I don't think I can.

991
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,220
SPEAKER_04: Chunsheng, it's cold.

992
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,399
SPEAKER_04: Come inside.

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,659
SPEAKER_03: Yes, come in.

994
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,199
SPEAKER_03: No, thank you, I've got to go.

995
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:32,039
SPEAKER_19: I snuck out just now...

996
01:47:32,109 --> 01:47:33,899
SPEAKER_19: and better get back.

997
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:44,350
SPEAKER_19: Chunsheng, remember...

998
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:46,539
SPEAKER_29: you still owe us a life!

999
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:49,079
SPEAKER_29: You've got to value yours!

1000
01:48:14,409 --> 01:48:16,680
SPEAKER_29: Mr. Niu, is your wife at home?

1001
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,810
SPEAKER_29: Yes.

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_09: What are these eggs for?

1003
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:25,989
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's about to have a baby.
It's to thank the matchmaker!

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_07: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_03: Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_03: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_03: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_03: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_03: So we've got to get going.

1010
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,779
SPEAKER_04: We'll bring the baby to see you.

1011
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,899
SPEAKER_04: - But you won't stay?
- No, thanks.

1012
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:00,090
SPEAKER_04: Never mind. Let's go. Don't worry.

1013
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,289
SPEAKER_04: Why's she crying?

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_09: What's happened?

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_09: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_09: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_09: I have to confess my crimes.

1018
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,939
SPEAKER_04: You! Crimes?

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_03: You, a capitalist?

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_03: Everyone knows you.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_09: I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_09: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1023
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:33,449
SPEAKER_04: When will they let you return?

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_09: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_09: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_09: Go now, I'll be okay.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_03: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1028
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:59,180
SPEAKER_29: We'll visit you after
she's out of the hospital.

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
SPEAKER_09: Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.

1030
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:08,390
SPEAKER_15: Everything's fine and normal.

1031
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:12,460
SPEAKER_15: They say she's great. No problems.

1032
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:15,359
SPEAKER_04: When is it due?

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_15: From the contractions, not right now.

1034
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:23,710
SPEAKER_15: Fengxia, don't be nervous.

1035
01:50:23,939 --> 01:50:25,609
SPEAKER_29: Won't hurt a bit.

1036
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:29,010
SPEAKER_29: Remember to breathe and push.

1037
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:34,420
SPEAKER_29: When you're pushing, bite on a towel.

1038
01:50:35,659 --> 01:50:37,350
SPEAKER_29: Where's the towel?

1039
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,430
SPEAKER_29: Here, bite on this. It'll save your teeth.

1040
01:50:47,399 --> 01:50:49,829
SPEAKER_29: Do whatever the doctor tells you.

1041
01:50:50,039 --> 01:50:52,130
SPEAKER_29: It'll be quick if you push.

1042
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:54,829
SPEAKER_16: Do as Mommy says and push.

1043
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:56,640
SPEAKER_16: Everything will be fine.

1044
01:50:56,939 --> 01:50:59,970
SPEAKER_02: What's this about pushing?
Too early for pushing!

1045
01:51:00,409 --> 01:51:03,750
SPEAKER_02: And what's this shouting? Out!

1046
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:06,250
SPEAKER_02: Go wait in the corridor.

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_03: Okay, we're going.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_03: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1049
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:13,220
SPEAKER_08: Sit down.

1050
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:26,840
SPEAKER_04: They're all so young.

1051
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:29,000
SPEAKER_04: Are they nurses?

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_18: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_18: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_18: You haven't seen any doctors?

1055
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,239
SPEAKER_30: No.

1056
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,310
SPEAKER_04: Go ask where the doctors are.

1057
01:51:39,489 --> 01:51:41,579
SPEAKER_04: We must find a good doctor.

1058
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,550
SPEAKER_12: They've been locked away.

1059
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:48,020
SPEAKER_12: The Red Guards are in control!

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_18: No doctors?

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
SPEAKER_15: Comrade, are there any doctors?

1062
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,159
SPEAKER_15: Yes, us!

1063
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,399
SPEAKER_15: I mean, older ones.

1064
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:06,930
SPEAKER_02: They're all reactionaries.
We've overthrown them.

1065
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:10,609
SPEAKER_02: Relax. Your wife's fine. We can handle this.

1066
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,359
SPEAKER_04: Erxi, I'm worried.

1067
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:24,899
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's a mute.

1068
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,300
SPEAKER_04: Can these young people cope?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_18: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_18: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1071
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,239
SPEAKER_15: Have to get one out.

1072
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,710
SPEAKER_15: Let me think.

1073
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:11,300
SPEAKER_02: What is he doing here?
No reactionaries allowed!

1074
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:14,939
SPEAKER_02: Wang Bin! Stand up!

1075
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:22,050
SPEAKER_15: This is the same Wang Bin
who once insulted...

1076
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,359
SPEAKER_15: me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1077
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,359
SPEAKER_08: How vile can you get?

1078
01:53:31,029 --> 01:53:33,159
SPEAKER_16: We dragged him here today...

1079
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,270
SPEAKER_16: to educate him, to criticize him...

1080
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,899
SPEAKER_16: and to let him witness her giving birth.

1081
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,909
SPEAKER_16: To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1082
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:45,409
SPEAKER_02: The working class is really something!

1083
01:53:45,479 --> 01:53:47,909
SPEAKER_02: Wang Bin, don't make any trouble.

1084
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:49,510
SPEAKER_02: Don't move.

1085
01:53:49,579 --> 01:53:51,909
SPEAKER_09: I wouldn't dare.

1086
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,289
SPEAKER_16: That's professor Wang...

1087
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,229
SPEAKER_16: head of obstetrics.

1088
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,029
SPEAKER_16: Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.

1089
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:19,439
SPEAKER_15: I was putting on a show.

1090
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,699
SPEAKER_15: We're not accusing you.

1091
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:23,770
SPEAKER_15: My wife's having a baby.

1092
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,350
SPEAKER_15: I wanted you here for her sake.

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_03: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_03: Let me wear it!

1095
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,199
SPEAKER_04: Go ask.

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_03: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_03: He's all right.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_18: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_18: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_18: I'll go buy some buns.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
SPEAKER_18: Where's Erxi?

1102
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:49,029
SPEAKER_04: They've gone to eat.

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_03: How's Fengxia?

1104
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,470
SPEAKER_04: They say she's fine.

1105
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:53,899
SPEAKER_04: Want one?

1106
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,069
SPEAKER_04: Give them to Dr. Wang.

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_04: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_03: Take your time. There's plenty.

1109
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:24,060
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_18: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1111
01:56:27,869 --> 01:56:29,899
SPEAKER_04: Will the baby be crippled?

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_18: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_18: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_18: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_18: to think of a name for the kid?

1116
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,390
SPEAKER_04: What name do you like?

1117
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,729
SPEAKER_04: "Don't Gamble."

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_18: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_18: What name do you like?

1120
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:08,949
SPEAKER_04: "Little Bun."

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_18: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_18: That's not a name!

1123
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,350
SPEAKER_04: But it's a tradition.

1124
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,949
SPEAKER_04: Cat, Dog or Little Bun...

1125
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,020
SPEAKER_04: are not recorded in the Register of Names.

1126
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:24,189
SPEAKER_04: He'd know for sure.

1127
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,789
SPEAKER_04: He doesn't know those kids exist...

1128
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:30,000
SPEAKER_04: so they don't die.

1129
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,829
SPEAKER_04: That's what the old folks say.

1130
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:37,739
SPEAKER_04: Okay, then Little Bun it is.

1131
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:40,109
SPEAKER_04: For now, anyway.

1132
01:57:41,149 --> 01:57:44,409
SPEAKER_04: Later, his dad can give him a proper name.

1133
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:08,430
SPEAKER_02: Where's the family of Xu Fengxia?

1134
01:58:09,739 --> 01:58:11,399
SPEAKER_02: It's a boy, 7.9 pounds.

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_03: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1136
01:58:13,779 --> 01:58:15,649
SPEAKER_02: We said it would be fine!

1137
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,310
SPEAKER_02: Comrade, how's my daughter?

1138
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,380
SPEAKER_04: Fine. Mother and son are fine.

1139
01:58:20,449 --> 01:58:22,510
SPEAKER_04: Is he normal?

1140
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,680
SPEAKER_04: Absolutely.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_03: Can we see them?

1142
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,550
SPEAKER_02: No, there's danger of infection.

1143
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:30,390
SPEAKER_04: Let us have a quick peek, please?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_03: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_08: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1146
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,260
SPEAKER_06: It's a boy.

1147
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:07,890
SPEAKER_06: They are fine. He's 7.9 pounds.

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_13: Do you hear him?

1149
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,329
SPEAKER_13: Are they in there?

1150
01:59:11,869 --> 01:59:13,460
SPEAKER_16: - Have a look.
- Not yet!

1151
01:59:13,539 --> 01:59:15,529
SPEAKER_12: Please, I'm the father!

1152
01:59:15,609 --> 01:59:18,239
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't matter. We're not done yet.

1153
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:23,270
SPEAKER_02: Wait outside. When we're finished,
you can see her as much as you want.

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_02: We'll see them soon.

1155
01:59:28,289 --> 01:59:29,720
SPEAKER_12: Is it a boy?

1156
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:32,279
SPEAKER_12: Yes, 7.9 pounds!

1157
01:59:32,659 --> 01:59:35,289
SPEAKER_13: - How is he?
- They're both fine!

1158
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:37,689
SPEAKER_16: Erxi, you're a lucky man!

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_08: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_08: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,760
SPEAKER_15: If you get a car from the factory...

1162
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,399
SPEAKER_15: we can drive Fengxia home.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_01: Good idea.

1164
01:59:53,949 --> 01:59:57,439
SPEAKER_04: Erxi, seeing as they are both fine...

1165
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,850
SPEAKER_04: why don't you see Dr. Wang back.

1166
02:00:00,789 --> 02:00:02,380
SPEAKER_16: What's with him?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_16: He ate too quickly.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_25: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_25: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1170
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:23,630
SPEAKER_24: Quick, get some water.

1171
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:28,539
SPEAKER_15: You two get the car, we'll be fine.

1172
02:00:40,989 --> 02:00:42,590
SPEAKER_15: Have some water.

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_03: Careful, it's hot.

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,579
SPEAKER_04: Some water should help.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_03: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_03: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_03: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_03: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_03: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,329 --> 02:01:16,520
SPEAKER_03: Quick!

1181
02:01:34,449 --> 02:01:36,810
SPEAKER_13: Don't panic. Think of something.

1182
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:40,979
SPEAKER_22: We're just students.
We don't know what to do.

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_03: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1184
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:48,920
SPEAKER_29: Yes, he's a professor.

1185
02:01:49,130 --> 02:01:50,689
SPEAKER_02: He'd know for sure.

1186
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,960
SPEAKER_02: He'll know.

1187
02:01:53,029 --> 02:01:54,930
SPEAKER_13: Get Dr. Wang over here.

1188
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,770
SPEAKER_13: What's wrong with him? What happened?

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
SPEAKER_03: He's eaten too much.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_13: What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_08: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_08: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_08: But he was okay after the water.

1194
02:02:15,149 --> 02:02:18,020
SPEAKER_05: It was the water that did it.

1195
02:02:18,619 --> 02:02:20,680
SPEAKER_16: Never mind. Drag him over!

1196
02:02:21,489 --> 02:02:23,720
SPEAKER_16: She's bleeding! Quick!

1197
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:36,270
SPEAKER_22: Please, Doctor, please!

1198
02:02:37,739 --> 02:02:39,539
SPEAKER_22: You'll pull through!

1199
02:02:40,649 --> 02:02:42,199
SPEAKER_22: It's all right.

1200
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,949
SPEAKER_22: Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1201
02:02:52,289 --> 02:02:53,590
SPEAKER_14: Dr. Wang!

1202
02:02:53,989 --> 02:02:56,149
SPEAKER_13: - Feeling better?
- Not at all.

1203
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:58,659
SPEAKER_13: Oxygen.

1204
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:11,069
SPEAKER_22: Fengxia! You'll pull through.
Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1205
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,210
SPEAKER_22: Please, Doctor, she's my only daughter.

1206
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,250
SPEAKER_00: The only child I have left.

1207
02:03:26,859 --> 02:03:30,420
SPEAKER_11: Fengxia! Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1208
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:53,039
SPEAKER_11: Some years later...

1209
02:04:30,189 --> 02:04:32,680
SPEAKER_02: Grandpa! It's crooked again.

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_03: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_03: I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_03: Take the medicine to Granny.

1213
02:04:45,739 --> 02:04:47,800
SPEAKER_02: Granny, your medicine.

1214
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:49,770
SPEAKER_02: Back already?

1215
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,569
SPEAKER_02: Has Little Bun been a good boy?

1216
02:04:52,109 --> 02:04:54,579
SPEAKER_02: I delivered 10 thermoses of water.

1217
02:04:56,279 --> 02:04:58,010
SPEAKER_04: Such a good little boy.

1218
02:04:58,079 --> 02:04:59,850
SPEAKER_04: Ten whole thermoses.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_03: Have you had your medicine?

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_03: I'll make lunch.

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_18: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_18: give me a hand.

1223
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:14,859
SPEAKER_02: I light the fire?

1224
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:18,770
SPEAKER_03: Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1225
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,609
SPEAKER_04: I want to visit Fengxia's grave again...

1226
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:28,310
SPEAKER_04: and take Little Bun's photos...

1227
02:05:28,979 --> 02:05:30,510
SPEAKER_04: to show her.

1228
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,149
SPEAKER_04: He's another year older.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_04: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_15: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1231
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,029
SPEAKER_15: We should've bought them
on the way home.

1232
02:05:50,539 --> 02:05:52,659
SPEAKER_15: Now we've got to carry them!

1233
02:05:53,369 --> 02:05:55,399
SPEAKER_15: Careful! Don't drop them!

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_03: Are you happy?

1235
02:05:59,909 --> 02:06:02,470
SPEAKER_02: Grandpa, where will the chicks live?

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_03: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_03: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1238
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:27,729
SPEAKER_02: Youqing eats dumplings.

1239
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:29,800
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia looks at photos.

1240
02:06:30,439 --> 02:06:33,710
SPEAKER_02: Little Bun, do you know who Youqing is?

1241
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:35,039
SPEAKER_04: Uncle.

1242
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:37,770
SPEAKER_04: - And Fengxia?
- Mommy.

1243
02:06:39,289 --> 02:06:40,979
SPEAKER_06: What a clever boy!

1244
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,779
SPEAKER_02: Granny, why all the photos for Fengxia?

1245
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:48,619
SPEAKER_04: Before you were born...

1246
02:06:49,729 --> 02:06:51,890
SPEAKER_04: Granny said to mommy that...

1247
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:55,069
SPEAKER_04: she should take a photo every year.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_03: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_03: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_18: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_18: He's a professor, after all.

1252
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:11,449
SPEAKER_04: He always carries on like this.

1253
02:07:11,979 --> 02:07:13,350
SPEAKER_16: It's okay.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_18: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_18: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_18: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_18: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_18: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_18: It's much too much.

1260
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:38,510
SPEAKER_04: Erxi, is it true that Dr. Wang...

1261
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,779
SPEAKER_04: won't eat buns, only rice now?

1262
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:44,180
SPEAKER_16: Not just buns...

1263
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:46,310
SPEAKER_16: anything made from wheat.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_18: Rice costs more than wheat.

1265
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,949
SPEAKER_04: What a food bill he must have.

1266
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,979
SPEAKER_15: - I'll make dinner.
- I'll help.

1267
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:21,010
SPEAKER_15: No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.

1268
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:24,510
SPEAKER_15: Little Bun, behave yourself.

1269
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:28,789
SPEAKER_02: Grandpa, where'll we put the chicks?

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_02: Let's see.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_03: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_03: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_03: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_03: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_03: And soon they'll grow up.

1276
02:09:05,329 --> 02:09:08,060
SPEAKER_02: When will they grow up?

1277
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:09,829
SPEAKER_02: Very soon.

1278
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,630
SPEAKER_02: And then?

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_03: And then...

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_03: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_03: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_03: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1283
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:27,310
SPEAKER_02: And after the oxen?

1284
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:30,079
SPEAKER_06: After oxen...

1285
02:09:32,189 --> 02:09:35,319
SPEAKER_06: After oxen, Little Bun will grow up.

1286
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,489
SPEAKER_02: I want to ride on an ox's back!

1287
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,829
SPEAKER_04: You will ride on an ox's back.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_03: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_18: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_18: and life will get better and better.
