SPEAKER_09: Let's play!

114
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,850
SPEAKER_09: Go!

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,720
SPEAKER_09: Let's roll!

135
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,950
SPEAKER_09: What are you doing?

136
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,110
SPEAKER_09: It's not over yet!

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_09: Sit down.

138
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,919
SPEAKER_09: - Sit down!

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_09: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
SPEAKER_09: I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480
SPEAKER_09: Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_09: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_09: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_09: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_09: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_09: Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_09: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_09: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_09: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170

- They're shooting!

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_09: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_09: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_09: What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_09: What is this?

500
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,320
SPEAKER_09: Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_09: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_09: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_09: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_09: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_09: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_09: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_09: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_09: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
SPEAKER_09: I'm talking to you.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_09: Daddy.

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_09: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380

SPEAKER_09: and we'll liberate Taiwan!

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_09: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_09: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_09: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_09: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_09: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_09: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_09: Let her go!

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_09: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_09: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_09: No!

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_09: You can't keep them. Burn them!

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,869
SPEAKER_09: Comrade Wan Erxi.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_09: Erxi painted this.

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_09: Erxi is good with his hands.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_09: You've gone to so much trouble.

831
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:14,779
SPEAKER_09: Please come again.

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489

1158
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:37,689
SPEAKER_09: Erxi, you're a lucky man!

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_09: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1181
02:01:34,449 --> 02:01:36,810
SPEAKER_09: Don't panic. Think of something.

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_09: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_09: What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_09: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_09: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_09: But he was okay after the water.
