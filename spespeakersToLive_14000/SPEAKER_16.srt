30
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,020
SPEAKER_16: Come often. You're always welcome.

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_16: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_16: Get out of my sight!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_16: What happened? No one's left?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
SPEAKER_16: - Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_16: This is too much.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_16: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_16: Sit then. Right in front of me!

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_16: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_16: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_16: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_16: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_16: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_16: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_16: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_16: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_16: Can't you see?

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_16: Do you hear him?

1149
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,329
SPEAKER_16: Are they in there?

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_16: We'll see them soon.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_16: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_16: Yes, just gobbled them up.
