28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,340
SPEAKER_12: Why don't you have a go?
Show them what it takes.

29
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,080
SPEAKER_12: Business is good, Mr. Xie.

105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,879
SPEAKER_12: Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,450
SPEAKER_12: Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,559
SPEAKER_12: What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_12: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_12: I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_12: Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_12: Want me to help you?

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_12: A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_12: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_12: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_12: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
SPEAKER_12: They are fabulous.

246
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,250
SPEAKER_12: My heart is full of sorrow

247
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,339
SPEAKER_12: It's that hateful bandit, Jiang

248
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,619
SPEAKER_12: I'm lucky to be alive

760
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,979
SPEAKER_12: He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_12: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,119
SPEAKER_12: He was very busy?

943
01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:24,050
SPEAKER_12: Dad, I saw Chunsheng yesterday.

946
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,930
SPEAKER_12: We have to draw a line between us and him.

1031
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:12,460
SPEAKER_12: They say she's great. No problems.

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_12: From the contractions, not right now.

1034
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:23,710
SPEAKER_12: Fengxia, don't be nervous.
