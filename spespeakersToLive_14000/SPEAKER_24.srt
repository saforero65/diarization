171
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,500
SPEAKER_24: The Xu family home...

172
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,099
SPEAKER_24: goes to Long'er.

173
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,640
SPEAKER_24: And the debt is hereby settled.

278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_24: What a bloodbath.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_24: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_24: No one's looking after them?

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_24: Was it from some dead officer?

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_24: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
SPEAKER_24: How could that be?

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_24: The Reds must be on the attack.

306
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,599
SPEAKER_24: Home!

307
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,769
SPEAKER_24: Home?

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
SPEAKER_24: Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_24: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_24: and you'll be shot.

311
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,550
SPEAKER_24: Better to wait and become a POW.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_24: The Reds send POWs home.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_24: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_24: You want to go home, don't run.

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_24: How?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_24: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_24: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_24: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_24: Just put those hands up.

331
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,849
SPEAKER_24: Where did you find this coat?

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_24: The coat's from my brother's unit.
