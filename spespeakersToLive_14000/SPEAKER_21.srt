387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_21: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_21: Fugui, you're back just in time...

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_21: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_21: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_21: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_21: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_21: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_21: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_21: Your timber was first class!

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_21: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_21: We'll take these.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_21: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_21: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_21: When you're hungry...

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_21: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_21: So let's get that metal.

471
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:12,570
SPEAKER_21: The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:15,900
SPEAKER_21: You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,510
SPEAKER_21: and after that...

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_21: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_21: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_21: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_21: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,219
SPEAKER_21: Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_21: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,500
SPEAKER_21: We've made enough steel
for three cannon balls.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_21: They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_21: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_21: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_21: and the last in the toilet!

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_21: The District Chief has come.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_21: Everyone knows about them.

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_21: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_21: Classic feudal types.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_21: Fetch a brazier.

749
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:34,750
SPEAKER_21: He works in a factory in the county seat.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_21: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_21: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

764
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,449
SPEAKER_21: Comrade Wan Erxi's here.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_21: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_21: Solid working class stock.

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
SPEAKER_21: Where's Fengxia?

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_21: Comrade Fengxia.

786
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:36,689
SPEAKER_21: Let's go.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399
SPEAKER_21: Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_21: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_21: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_21: Let's sing a song!

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_21: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_21: What are these eggs for?

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_21: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_21: So we've got to get going.

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_21: What's happened?

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_21: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_21: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_21: I have to confess my crimes.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_21: I have faith in the Party.

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_21: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_21: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_21: Go now, I'll be okay.

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
SPEAKER_21: Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.
