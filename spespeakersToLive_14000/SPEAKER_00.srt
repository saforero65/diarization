61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_00: He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,319
SPEAKER_00: You're up.

63
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,970
SPEAKER_00: What's wrong?

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_00: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_00: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_00: Youqing, excellent.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_00: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_00: It's crowded with all of us here.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_00: Which corpses?

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_00: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_00: Mother died without knowing where I was.

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_00: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_00: She can't even say "Daddy."

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_00: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_00: He burnt it?

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_00: they captured two mountains a day.

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_00: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_00: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_00: Do you expect me to believe that?

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_00: How do you like my singing?

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_00: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_00: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_00: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_00: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_00: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_00: You have to go smelt steel.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_00: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_00: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_00: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_00: Put these old things to new use.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_00: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_00: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_00: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_00: We'll discuss it later.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_00: He can run?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_00: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_00: I approve.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_00: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_00: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_00: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_00: Erxi, drink up.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_00: Just say what you want.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_00: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_00: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_00: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_00: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_00: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_00: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_00: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_00: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_00: I'll go buy some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_00: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_00: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_00: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_00: Why not use this time...

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_00: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_00: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_00: That's not a name!

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_00: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_00: give me a hand.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_00: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_00: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_00: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_00: He's a professor, after all.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_00: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_00: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_00: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_00: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_00: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_00: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_00: Rice costs more than wheat.

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_00: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_00: and life will get better and better.
