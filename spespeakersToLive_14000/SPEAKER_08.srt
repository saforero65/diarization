20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_08: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_08: How much?

24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_08: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_08: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_08: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

54
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,519
SPEAKER_08: I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,360
SPEAKER_08: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_08: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_08: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_08: It's not good for the baby.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_08: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_08: Fugui...

78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,819
SPEAKER_08: Can't rush these things.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,089
SPEAKER_08: Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_08: My luck's changed.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_08: Write that down. Another round.

90
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,250
SPEAKER_08: Well?

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
SPEAKER_08: No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,779
SPEAKER_08: This is the last time, okay? I promise.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_08: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_08: It's settled.

97
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,529
SPEAKER_08: get a rickshaw to take my wife home. I'm...

98
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,389
SPEAKER_08: Of course.

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_08: You can't just win and walk away.

130
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,330
SPEAKER_08: The game's not over yet!

146
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,529
SPEAKER_08: We'll formalize the transfer in a few days...

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,289
SPEAKER_08: and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_08: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_08: We'll settle everything then.

150
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,929
SPEAKER_08: Okay?

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_08: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_08: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_08: Just call me Fugui.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_08: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_08: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_08: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_08: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_08: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_08: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_08: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_08: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_08: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

324
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,940
SPEAKER_08: - The attack hasn't started.
- Let's put them down.

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_08: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_08: Fengxia!

343
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,190
SPEAKER_08: It's your daddy.

344
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,440
SPEAKER_08: What are you doing?

345
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,769
SPEAKER_08: Where's mommy?

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_08: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_08: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_08: How come Fengxia can't talk?

377
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,000
SPEAKER_08: Fugui's back.

378
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:52,429
SPEAKER_08: This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_08: You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_08: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_08: That's taking part.

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_08: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_08: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_08: They shot him.

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_08: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_08: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_08: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_08: that'd have been me.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_08: What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_08: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_08: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_08: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_08: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_08: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_08: You can leave those.

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_08: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_08: We're off to the next house.

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_08: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_08: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_08: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_08: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_08: You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_08: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_08: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_08: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_08: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
SPEAKER_08: Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,909
SPEAKER_08: Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,599
SPEAKER_08: come see the show.

547
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_08: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909
SPEAKER_08: He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:25,420
SPEAKER_08: and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
SPEAKER_08: I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,139
SPEAKER_08: Far away, we flee with haste

552
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,710
SPEAKER_08: Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

575
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,690
SPEAKER_08: We've smelted our steel...

576
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,989
SPEAKER_08: and reached our production target.

577
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:54,500
SPEAKER_08: We're off to report the good news.

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_08: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
SPEAKER_08: Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

589
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,880
SPEAKER_08: He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_08: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_08: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_08: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_08: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_08: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_08: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_08: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_08: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_08: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_08: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_08: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_08: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_08: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_08: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_08: The sheep will turn into an ox.

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_08: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_08: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

631
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,670
SPEAKER_08: It's Fugui's son?

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_08: You're the District Chief?

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_08: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_08: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

680
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,689
SPEAKER_08: I had only one son!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_08: And you killed him!

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_08: I think you should go, Chief.

720
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,140
SPEAKER_08: Sit here.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
SPEAKER_08: You have to get rid of those puppets.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_08: Don't you see what they are?

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_08: Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,930
SPEAKER_08: Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_08: I've found just the man for her.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
SPEAKER_08: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_08: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_08: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_08: He's also got a handicap...

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_08: Yes, and run if he has to.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_08: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_08: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_08: No, really.

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_08: From where?

820
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,510
SPEAKER_08: You're just in time. We've just finished.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_08: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_08: Do stay! Come on inside.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_08: "The working class leads us all."

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_08: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_08: We're happy if you are.

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_08: Anytime. You decide.

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_08: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

873
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:45,880
SPEAKER_08: Congratulations on Fengxia's wedding.

874
01:37:46,289 --> 01:37:48,760
SPEAKER_08: - When did you get here?
- A while ago.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_08: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_08: Jiazhen, make some tea.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_08: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_08: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_08: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_08: Don't be like that.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_08: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_08: But here's boiled water.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_08: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_08: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_08: Can't we put this behind us?

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_08: But it's Chairman Mao.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_08: Better when you come over.

908
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:50,100
SPEAKER_08: Help me with the table.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_08: No wonder there's a bottle!

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,329
SPEAKER_08: Really?

916
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:38,680
SPEAKER_08: Cheers!

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_08: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_08: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_08: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_08: And will be better for your child.

936
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,920
SPEAKER_08: This is great.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_08: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_08: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_08: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_08: You came for this?

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_08: All my debts will have been paid.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_08: What do you mean?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_08: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_08: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_08: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_08: Have you seen her body?

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_08: You mustn't lose hope.

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_08: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_08: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_08: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_08: I don't want to live anymore!

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_08: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_08: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_08: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_08: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_08: you've got to bear it!

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,659
SPEAKER_08: Yes, come in.

994
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,199
SPEAKER_08: No, thank you, I've got to go.

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_08: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_08: Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_08: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_08: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_08: You, a capitalist?

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_08: Everyone knows you.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_08: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1030
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:08,390
SPEAKER_08: Everything's fine and normal.

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_08: Okay, we're going.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_08: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1059
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:48,020
SPEAKER_08: The Red Guards are in control!

1081

SPEAKER_08: To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_08: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_08: Let me wear it!

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_08: How's Fengxia?

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_08: Take your time. There's plenty.

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_08: to think of a name for the kid?

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_08: What name do you like?

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_08: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_08: Can we see them?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_08: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_08: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_08: Good idea.

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_08: Careful, it's hot.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_08: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_08: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_08: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_08: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_08: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,329 --> 02:01:16,520
SPEAKER_08: Quick!

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
SPEAKER_08: He's eaten too much.

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_08: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_08: I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_08: Take the medicine to Granny.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_08: Have you had your medicine?

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_08: I'll make lunch.

1224

SPEAKER_08: Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_08: Are you happy?

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_08: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_08: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_08: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_08: everything would've been fine.

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_08: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_08: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_08: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_08: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...
