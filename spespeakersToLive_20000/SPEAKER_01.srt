SPEAKER_01: Why don't you have a go?
Show them what it takes.

105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,879
SPEAKER_01: Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,450
SPEAKER_01: Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,559
SPEAKER_01: What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_01: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

124
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,149
SPEAKER_01: It's all in order, I'll be going.

125
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,379
SPEAKER_01: Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

126
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,950
SPEAKER_01: for leaving you homeless.

127
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,590
SPEAKER_01: But I sure like that mansion of yours.

128
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,230
SPEAKER_01: See you there in a few days.

132
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,769
SPEAKER_01: but you've nothing left.
What would you wager?

133
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,809
SPEAKER_01: If you're unhappy, talk to Mr. Xie.

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_01: This can't be happening!

183
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,660
SPEAKER_01: It's valuable. Don't scratch it. Take it slowly.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_01: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_01: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_01: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_01: I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_01: Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_01: Want me to help you?

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_01: A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_01: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

228
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,769
SPEAKER_01: This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,369
SPEAKER_01: Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_01: Great at any price.

231
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,009
SPEAKER_01: I've given up the puppet troupe.

232

SPEAKER_01: Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,990
SPEAKER_01: I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_01: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_01: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,190
SPEAKER_01: Earn your money yourself.

244
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,529
SPEAKER_01: Put together a troupe.

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
SPEAKER_01: They are fabulous.

246
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,250
SPEAKER_01: My heart is full of sorrow

247
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,339
SPEAKER_01: It's that hateful bandit, Jiang

248
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,619
SPEAKER_01: I'm lucky to be alive

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_01: Good idea.
