SPEAKER_24: I've said all there is to say.

157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,659
SPEAKER_24: If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
SPEAKER_24: I won't let him be like you.

195
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,990
SPEAKER_24: He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_24: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_24: What's his name?

655
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:51,590
SPEAKER_24: a nice, deep sleep.

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,739
SPEAKER_24: In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,640
SPEAKER_24: So sleep well now.

658
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:08,220
SPEAKER_24: Mommy will come see you every day.

659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,649
SPEAKER_24: Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_24: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_24: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_24: from making you go.

663
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,109
SPEAKER_24: It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_24: If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
SPEAKER_24: I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

666
01:17:51,489 --> 01:17:53,430
SPEAKER_24: Oh, my poor darling.

669
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:32,529
SPEAKER_24: What's he doing here?

670
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,859
SPEAKER_24: Tell him to leave. He killed my son.

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_24: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_24: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,100
SPEAKER_24: You killed him! Give him back to me!

692
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,970
SPEAKER_24: Go away!

693
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,640
SPEAKER_24: Remember, you owe us a life.

694
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,380

905
01:40:33,989 --> 01:40:35,510
SPEAKER_24: Have you eaten?

909
01:40:59,109 --> 01:41:01,510
SPEAKER_24: You brought a bottle.

1194
02:02:15,149 --> 02:02:18,020
SPEAKER_24: It was the water that did it.

1195
02:02:18,619 --> 02:02:20,680
SPEAKER_24: Never mind. Drag him over!

1196
02:02:21,489 --> 02:02:23,720
SPEAKER_24: She's bleeding! Quick!

1201
02:02:52,289 --> 02:02:53,590
SPEAKER_24: Dr. Wang!

1202
