59
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,939
SPEAKER_16: Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_16: This can't be happening!

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_16: Sit down.

138
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,919
SPEAKER_16: - Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

252
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,289
SPEAKER_16: Come on! Get a move on!

253
00:28:56,589 --> 00:29:00,589
SPEAKER_16: 1949: Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army
is losing the civil war.

254
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,529
SPEAKER_16: The Communists under Mao Zedong
are poised to take over China.

255
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,670
SPEAKER_16: So we're fighting the Communists.

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_16: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_16: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_16: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_16: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_16: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

289
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,220
SPEAKER_16: The wounded who froze to death.

290
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,420
SPEAKER_16: Put it on. We must survive.

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_16: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_16: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_16: What happened? No one's left?

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,589
SPEAKER_16: They've all run off.

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
SPEAKER_16: How could that be?

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_16: The Reds must be on the attack.

311
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,550
SPEAKER_16: Better to wait and become a POW.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_16: The Reds send POWs home.

330
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,269
SPEAKER_16: Lao Quan! They're shooting!

331
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,849
SPEAKER_16: Where did you find this coat?

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_16: The coat's from my brother's unit.

334
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,360
SPEAKER_16: - What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

335
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,730
SPEAKER_16: What's your brother look like?

336
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,269
SPEAKER_16: Just like me.

337
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,019
SPEAKER_16: Lao Quan!

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_16: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_16: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_16: We're off to the next house.

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_16: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_16: What did you think you were doing?

517
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:23,280
SPEAKER_16: You won't go?

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_16: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_16: Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_16: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610
SPEAKER_16: You, looking after us! After all these years.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_16: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_16: Say I want him to.

570
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,329
SPEAKER_16: Good boy, bring it over here.

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_16: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_16: How do you like my singing?

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_16: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_16: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_16: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_16: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
SPEAKER_16: Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_16: They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_16: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_16: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_16: and the last in the toilet!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_16: And you killed him!

699
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:44,560
SPEAKER_16: Go away!

700
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,439
SPEAKER_16: All right.

701
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,340
SPEAKER_16: I'm going.

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_16: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_16: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_16: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_16: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_16: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_16: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_16: Let her go!

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_16: Are you mad?

812
01:30:33,149 --> 01:30:35,180
SPEAKER_16: Don't forget your package!

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_16: Do stay! Come on inside.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_16: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_16: Let's sing a song!

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_16: Hold your little Red Books.

858
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,180
SPEAKER_16: Clear a path! Ship sailing through!

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
SPEAKER_16: Time to wrap up.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_16: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_16: What are these eggs for?

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
SPEAKER_16: Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.
