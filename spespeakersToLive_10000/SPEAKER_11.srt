102
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,740
SPEAKER_11: Come, give Mrs. Xu a seat.

109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330
SPEAKER_11: Get out!

110
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,870
SPEAKER_11: I've just...

111
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,240
SPEAKER_11: Let's play!

130
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,330
SPEAKER_11: The game's not over yet!

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_11: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

140
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,769
SPEAKER_11: I am very sorry, but you've got nothing left.

141
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,779
SPEAKER_11: What could you stake the bet on?
We don't accept empty bets.

142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
SPEAKER_11: I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480
SPEAKER_11: Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_11: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

163
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,400
SPEAKER_11: Mr. Xu, any mistakes?

313
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,460
SPEAKER_11: So, no running?

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_11: How?

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_11: How could you?

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_11: This is too much.

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_11: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_11: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_11: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_11: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_11: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_11: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_11: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_11: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_11: Youqing! Look what you've done!

642
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,350
SPEAKER_11: Answer me!

643
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,460
SPEAKER_11: Daddy's here! Say something!

672
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,609
SPEAKER_11: It's me, Chunsheng.

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_11: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_11: No!

799
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:00,890
SPEAKER_11: Comrade, could I look at that one?

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_11: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_11: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_11: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

855
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,229
SPEAKER_11: Time for a photo!

856
01:35:18,869 --> 01:35:20,840
SPEAKER_11: Move aside! Stand still!

863
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:17,989
SPEAKER_11: Chairman Mao...

864
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:21,600
SPEAKER_11: Comrade Fengxia's mine now.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_11: Can't you see?

1042
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:54,829
SPEAKER_11: Do as Mommy says and push.

1043
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:56,640
SPEAKER_11: Everything will be fine.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_11: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1078
01:53:31,029 --> 01:53:33,159
SPEAKER_11: We dragged him here today...

1079
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,270
SPEAKER_11: to educate him, to criticize him...

1080
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,899
SPEAKER_11: and to let him witness her giving birth.

1081
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,909
SPEAKER_11: To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_11: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_11: Do you hear him?

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_11: We'll see them soon.

1157
01:59:32,659 --> 01:59:35,289
SPEAKER_11: - How is he?
- They're both fine!

1158
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:37,689
SPEAKER_11: Erxi, you're a lucky man!

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_11: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,760
SPEAKER_11: If you get a car from the factory...

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_11: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
SPEAKER_11: He's eaten too much.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_11: What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_11: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_11: He was starving.

1253
02:07:11,979 --> 02:07:13,350
SPEAKER_11: It's okay.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_11: We shouldn't have given him water.
