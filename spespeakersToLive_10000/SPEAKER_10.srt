37
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,800
SPEAKER_10: One more night like this...

38
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:19,209
SPEAKER_10: you'll have him right where you want him.

39
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,100

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,080
SPEAKER_10: Master Fugui, your wife's here.

89
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,059

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_10: What do you mean?

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200

It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,110
SPEAKER_10: You don't have a roof tile to your name.

123
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,620

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,289
SPEAKER_10: and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_10: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_10: We'll settle everything then.

150

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_10: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

776
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,909

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_10: Time does fly!

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_10: Let's not talk about it.
