SPEAKER_06: A dog's gotta eat shit! Little bastard!

48

SPEAKER_06: If you don't stop...

49
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,839
SPEAKER_06: we'll lose the little we have.

50
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:30,040
SPEAKER_06: Aren't you capable of anything else?

51
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,410
SPEAKER_06: Is gambling all you know?

52
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,490

168
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,829

and debts must be paid.

169
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,170

SPEAKER_06: Turtle spawn! I'll kill him!

178
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,390

179
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,329
SPEAKER_06: I'll never forgive you!
