24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_14: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_14: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_14: My luck's changed.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_14: Write that down. Another round.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_14: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_14: But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
SPEAKER_14: Let's put the past behind us...

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_14: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_14: You've looked after us.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_14: Mother died without knowing where I was.

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_14: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_14: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_14: Wake up.

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_14: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_14: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_14: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_14: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_14: Don't be like that.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_14: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_14: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_14: Can't we put this behind us?

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_14: If only Youqing had been here today.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
SPEAKER_14: I'll be going.

1011
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,899
SPEAKER_14: - But you won't stay?
- No, thanks.

1012
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:00,090
SPEAKER_14: Never mind. Let's go. Don't worry.

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_14: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_14: He's all right.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_14: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_14: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_14: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_14: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_14: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,329 --> 02:01:16,520
SPEAKER_14: Quick!

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_14: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_14: give me a hand.

1233
02:05:53,369 --> 02:05:55,399
SPEAKER_14: Careful! Don't drop them!

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_14: Are you happy?

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_14: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_14: He's a professor, after all.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_14: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_14: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_14: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_14: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_14: And soon they'll grow up.

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_14: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_14: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_14: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_14: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_14: and life will get better and better.
