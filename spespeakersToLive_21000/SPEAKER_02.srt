71
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,899
SPEAKER_02: I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

74
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,879
SPEAKER_02: I've said all there is to say.

75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,009
SPEAKER_02: Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,110
SPEAKER_02: It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
SPEAKER_02: Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

80
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,459
SPEAKER_02: Please.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,689
SPEAKER_02: I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,470
SPEAKER_02: Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,700
SPEAKER_02: Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,509
SPEAKER_02: Tell me.

103
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,980
SPEAKER_02: Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,919
SPEAKER_02: Come home.

153
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,960
SPEAKER_02: I just wanted to tell you...

154
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,360
SPEAKER_02: I've realized...

155
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,340
SPEAKER_02: you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,600
SPEAKER_02: I'm taking Fengxia with me.

191
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,549
SPEAKER_02: Granny!

192
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,049
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,450
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen.

194
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,549
SPEAKER_02: Come look at your son.

198
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,789
SPEAKER_02: "Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,730
SPEAKER_02: He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,329
SPEAKER_02: Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,759
SPEAKER_02: Me.

202
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,509
SPEAKER_02: Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,509
SPEAKER_02: I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
SPEAKER_02: I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,450
SPEAKER_02: Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,619
SPEAKER_02: I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

208
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,160
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
SPEAKER_02: Let's put the past behind us...

212
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,009
SPEAKER_02: and live peacefully.

215
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,789
SPEAKER_02: I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

218
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,569
SPEAKER_02: Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,279
SPEAKER_02: but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,140
SPEAKER_02: We'll work something out.

221
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
SPEAKER_02: I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

223
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,579
SPEAKER_02: Don't say that.

224
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,509
SPEAKER_02: All I ask is a quiet life together.

352
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,920
SPEAKER_02: She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,849
SPEAKER_02: kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,570
SPEAKER_02: You should have written.

361
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,659
SPEAKER_02: and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,489
SPEAKER_02: I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,929
SPEAKER_02: Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,519
SPEAKER_02: The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,789
SPEAKER_02: It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,199
SPEAKER_02: They never get...

367
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,869
SPEAKER_02: a good night's sleep.

371
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,449
SPEAKER_02: In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,019
SPEAKER_02: For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,260
SPEAKER_02: No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,849
SPEAKER_02: When the fever came down...

375
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,059
SPEAKER_02: she'd lost her voice.

415
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,500
SPEAKER_02: What's wrong?

416
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
SPEAKER_02: Why are your pants wet?

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_02: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_02: They shot him.

427
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,730
SPEAKER_02: Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,070
SPEAKER_02: Ordinary townspeople.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_02: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

433
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,699
SPEAKER_02: Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,530
SPEAKER_02: Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,800
SPEAKER_02: Of course.

436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,969
SPEAKER_02: Poor townspeople.

438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,579
SPEAKER_02: Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,050
SPEAKER_02: I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,719
SPEAKER_02: Good idea!

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_02: You can leave those.

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_02: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_02: We're off to the next house.

523
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:49,469
SPEAKER_02: That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,239
SPEAKER_02: I tried to stop you.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_02: How so?

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_02: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610
SPEAKER_02: You, looking after us! After all these years.

537
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,380
SPEAKER_02: What do you know?

542
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,780
SPEAKER_02: Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,420
SPEAKER_02: Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

557
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,500
SPEAKER_02: Well?

558
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,300
SPEAKER_02: I'm not going!

559
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,750
SPEAKER_02: Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,110
SPEAKER_02: Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,409
SPEAKER_02: Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,599
SPEAKER_02: Take him tea full of vinegar.

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_02: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

592
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,970
SPEAKER_02: Let them sleep. They'll eat later.

599
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,920
SPEAKER_02: He's not going anywhere.
He hasn't slept in days.

600
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,390
SPEAKER_02: Leave him alone.

601
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,899
SPEAKER_02: - The District Chief is coming.
- So?

602
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,760
SPEAKER_02: A kid still has to sleep.

650
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:35,449
SPEAKER_02: Mommy's made you more...

651
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:39,449
SPEAKER_02: twenty this time.

652
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,880
SPEAKER_02: That should be enough.

653
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:46,289
SPEAKER_02: Once you've eaten...

654
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,489
SPEAKER_02: you can sleep...

668
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,989
SPEAKER_02: The one who ran over my son?

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_02: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_02: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_02: How can I ever make it up?

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_02: I think you should go, Chief.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_02: Don't you see what they are?

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_02: Classic feudal types.

745
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,390
SPEAKER_02: I'll tell you about him.

746
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,100
SPEAKER_02: Let's not let her in on it for now.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_02: I've found just the man for her.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
SPEAKER_02: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_02: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_02: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_02: He's also got a handicap...

754
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,170
SPEAKER_02: a lame leg.

755
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,329
SPEAKER_02: How lame? Can he walk?

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_02: Yes, and run if he has to.

758
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:00,949
SPEAKER_02: Was he born a cripple?

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
SPEAKER_02: No, it was an accident at work.

760
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,979
SPEAKER_02: He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_02: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_02: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

774
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,520
SPEAKER_02: A good family.

775
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,100
SPEAKER_02: The Liberation Army
gave me that certificate.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_02: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_02: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_02: No, really.

790
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,020
SPEAKER_02: Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?

791
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,760
SPEAKER_02: He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.

794
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,250
SPEAKER_02: I think she likes him.

795
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,779
SPEAKER_02: It's different from before. Look.

796
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,460
SPEAKER_02: Go ask Mr. Niu...

797
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:41,300
SPEAKER_02: what the boy thinks.

798
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,369
SPEAKER_02: How's this for Fengxia?

807
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:21,539
SPEAKER_02: Must be Wan Erxi!

808
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,310
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't like Fengxia,
so he tears the place down.

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_02: Erxi is good with his hands.

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_02: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_02: We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_02: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_02: Shall we set a date?

837
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,340
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's had a hard life.

838
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,109
SPEAKER_02: If you don't mind...

839
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,010
SPEAKER_02: let's make the wedding a real occasion.

840
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,920
SPEAKER_02: To make her happy.

852
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:00,319
SPEAKER_02: They're all singing for Fengxia...

853
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,479
SPEAKER_02: and she can't even join in!

880
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,649
SPEAKER_02: Water's not boiled.

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_02: If only Youqing had been here today.

894
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:36,130
SPEAKER_02: Give it back to him.

895
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,630
SPEAKER_02: I don't want his gifts.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_02: No wonder there's a bottle!

917
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,460
SPEAKER_02: Erxi, when you went to the hospital today...

918
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,560
SPEAKER_02: what did they say about Fengxia's health?

920
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,000
SPEAKER_02: Still, you can't be too careful.

921
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,829
SPEAKER_02: Your folks aren't around.

922
01:41:58,909 --> 01:42:02,069
SPEAKER_02: After the birth,
you'll stay with us for a while.

923
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:07,609
SPEAKER_02: Spend as much time as you can with her.

924
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:11,149
SPEAKER_02: When I was pregnant with Fengxia...

925
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,449
SPEAKER_02: her dad was never around.

935
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,260
SPEAKER_02: We haven't taken a photo in years.

937
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,529
SPEAKER_02: After the child is born...

938
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,399
SPEAKER_02: have a photo taken every year.

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_02: All my debts will have been paid.

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_02: You mustn't lose hope.

991
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,220
SPEAKER_02: Chunsheng, it's cold.

992
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,399
SPEAKER_02: Come inside.

1013
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,289
SPEAKER_02: Why's she crying?

1050
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:26,840
SPEAKER_02: They're all so young.

1051
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:29,000
SPEAKER_02: Are they nurses?

1056
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,310
SPEAKER_02: Go ask where the doctors are.

1057
01:51:39,489 --> 01:51:41,579
SPEAKER_02: We must find a good doctor.

1066
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,359
SPEAKER_02: Erxi, I'm worried.

1067
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:24,899
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's a mute.

1068
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,300
SPEAKER_02: Can these young people cope?

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_02: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_02: Let me wear it!

1095
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,199
SPEAKER_02: Go ask.

1102
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:49,029
SPEAKER_02: They've gone to eat.

1104
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,470
SPEAKER_02: They say she's fine.

1105
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:53,899
SPEAKER_02: Want one?

1106
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,069
SPEAKER_02: Give them to Dr. Wang.

1109
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:24,060
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?

1111
01:56:27,869 --> 01:56:29,899
SPEAKER_02: Will the baby be crippled?

1116
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,390
SPEAKER_02: What name do you like?

1117
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,729
SPEAKER_02: "Don't Gamble."

1120
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:08,949
SPEAKER_02: "Little Bun."

1123
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,350
SPEAKER_02: But it's a tradition.

1124
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,949
SPEAKER_02: Cat, Dog or Little Bun...

1125
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,020
SPEAKER_02: are not recorded in the Register of Names.

1126
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:24,189
SPEAKER_02: He'd know for sure.

1127
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,789
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't know those kids exist...

1128
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:30,000
SPEAKER_02: so they don't die.

1129
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,829
SPEAKER_02: That's what the old folks say.

1130
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:37,739
SPEAKER_02: Okay, then Little Bun it is.

1131
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:40,109
SPEAKER_02: For now, anyway.

1132
01:57:41,149 --> 01:57:44,409
SPEAKER_02: Later, his dad can give him a proper name.

1138
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,380
SPEAKER_02: Fine. Mother and son are fine.

1139
01:58:20,449 --> 01:58:22,510
SPEAKER_02: Is he normal?

1140
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,680
SPEAKER_02: Absolutely.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_02: Can we see them?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_02: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1165
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,850
SPEAKER_02: why don't you see Dr. Wang back.

1166
02:00:00,789 --> 02:00:02,380
SPEAKER_02: What's with him?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_02: He ate too quickly.

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,579
SPEAKER_02: Some water should help.

1217
02:04:56,279 --> 02:04:58,010
SPEAKER_02: Such a good little boy.

1218
02:04:58,079 --> 02:04:59,850
SPEAKER_02: Ten whole thermoses.

1225
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,609
SPEAKER_02: I want to visit Fengxia's grave again...

1226
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:28,310
SPEAKER_02: and take Little Bun's photos...

1227
02:05:28,979 --> 02:05:30,510
SPEAKER_02: to show her.

1228
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,149
SPEAKER_02: He's another year older.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_02: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_02: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1245
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:48,619
SPEAKER_02: Before you were born...

1252
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:11,449
SPEAKER_02: He always carries on like this.

1265
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,949
SPEAKER_02: What a food bill he must have.

1287
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,829
SPEAKER_02: You will ride on an ox's back.
