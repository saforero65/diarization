24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_13: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_13: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_13: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_13: He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,319
SPEAKER_13: You're up.

63
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,970
SPEAKER_13: What's wrong?

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_13: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_13: It's not good for the baby.

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_13: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_13: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_13: Let me wipe your tears.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_13: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_13: Fugui...

78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,819
SPEAKER_13: Can't rush these things.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,089
SPEAKER_13: Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
SPEAKER_13: No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,779
SPEAKER_13: This is the last time, okay? I promise.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_13: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_13: It's settled.

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_13: What do you mean?

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_13: You can't just win and walk away.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_13: Youqing, excellent.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_13: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_13: But I was too ashamed to see you.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_13: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_13: It's crowded with all of us here.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_13: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_13: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_13: Life won't be easy.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_13: Just call me Fugui.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_13: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_13: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_13: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_13: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_13: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_13: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_13: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_13: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_13: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_13: Which corpses?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_13: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_13: You've looked after us.

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_13: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_13: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_13: we've got to make it back alive.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_13: And live a good life.

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_13: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_13: Fengxia!

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_13: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_13: The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_13: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_13: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_13: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_13: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_13: I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_13: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_13: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_13: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_13: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_13: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_13: She can't even say "Daddy."

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_13: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_13: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_13: We won't see him for a while.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_13: He burnt it?

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_13: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_13: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_13: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_13: that'd have been me.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_13: What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_13: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_13: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_13: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_13: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_13: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_13: It can't be worth much.

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_13: they captured two mountains a day.

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_13: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_13: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_13: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_13: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_13: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_13: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_13: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_13: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_13: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_13: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_13: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_13: You have to go smelt steel.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_13: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_13: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_13: Have 20. You should eat more.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_13: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_13: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_13: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_13: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_13: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_13: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_13: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_13: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_13: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_13: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_13: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_13: The sheep will turn into an ox.

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_13: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_13: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_13: You're the District Chief?

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_13: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_13: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

718
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,710
SPEAKER_13: - You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_13: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_13: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_13: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_13: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_13: Put these old things to new use.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_13: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_13: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_13: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_13: He can run?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_13: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_13: I approve.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_13: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_13: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_13: From where?

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_13: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_13: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_13: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_13: "The working class leads us all."

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_13: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_13: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_13: Jiazhen, make some tea.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_13: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_13: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_13: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_13: Don't be like that.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_13: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_13: But here's boiled water.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_13: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_13: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_13: Can't we put this behind us?

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_13: On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_13: Better when you come over.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_13: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_13: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_13: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_13: And will be better for your child.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_13: Erxi, drink up.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_13: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_13: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_13: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_13: Just say what you want.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_13: You came for this?

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_13: What do you mean?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_13: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_13: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_13: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_13: Have you seen her body?

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_13: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_13: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_13: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_13: I don't want to live anymore!

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_13: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_13: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_13: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_13: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_13: you've got to bear it!

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_13: Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_13: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_13: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_13: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_13: So we've got to get going.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_13: You, a capitalist?

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_13: Everyone knows you.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_13: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_13: Okay, we're going.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_13: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_13: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_13: You haven't seen any doctors?

1055
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,239
SPEAKER_13: No.

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_13: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_13: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_13: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_13: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_13: He's all right.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_13: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_13: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_13: I'll go buy some buns.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
SPEAKER_13: Where's Erxi?

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_13: How's Fengxia?

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_13: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_13: Take your time. There's plenty.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_13: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_13: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_13: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_13: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_13: to think of a name for the kid?

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_13: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_13: What name do you like?

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_13: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_13: That's not a name!

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_13: Careful, it's hot.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_13: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_13: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_13: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_13: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_13: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,329 --> 02:01:16,520
SPEAKER_13: Quick!

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_13: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_13: I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_13: Take the medicine to Granny.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_13: Have you had your medicine?

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_13: I'll make lunch.

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_13: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_13: give me a hand.

1224
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:18,770
SPEAKER_13: Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_13: Are you happy?

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_13: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_13: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_13: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_13: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_13: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_13: He's a professor, after all.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_13: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_13: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_13: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_13: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_13: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_13: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_13: Rice costs more than wheat.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_13: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_13: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_13: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_13: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_13: And soon they'll grow up.

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_13: And then...

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_13: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_13: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_13: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_13: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_13: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_13: and life will get better and better.
