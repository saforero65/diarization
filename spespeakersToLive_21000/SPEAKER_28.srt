66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,149
SPEAKER_28: You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

67
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
SPEAKER_28: Who was gambling? I went to watch.

152
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,620
SPEAKER_28: Fugui...

157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,659
SPEAKER_28: If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
SPEAKER_28: I won't let him be like you.

195
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,990
SPEAKER_28: He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_28: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_28: What's his name?

379
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,400
SPEAKER_28: So you're our leading cadre.

538
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,150
SPEAKER_28: Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,869
SPEAKER_28: Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,860
SPEAKER_28: I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840
SPEAKER_28: Have I ever complained?

655
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:51,590
SPEAKER_28: a nice, deep sleep.

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,739
SPEAKER_28: In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,640
SPEAKER_28: So sleep well now.

658
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:08,220
SPEAKER_28: Mommy will come see you every day.

659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,649
SPEAKER_28: Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_28: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_28: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_28: from making you go.

663
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,109
SPEAKER_28: It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_28: If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
SPEAKER_28: I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

666
01:17:51,489 --> 01:17:53,430
SPEAKER_28: Oh, my poor darling.

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_28: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_28: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,100
SPEAKER_28: You killed him! Give him back to me!

692
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,970
SPEAKER_28: Go away!

693
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,640
SPEAKER_28: Remember, you owe us a life.

694
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,380
SPEAKER_28: You killed him. Remember that.

695
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,479
