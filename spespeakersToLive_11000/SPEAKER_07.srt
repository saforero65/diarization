386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_07: That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_07: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_07: to attend Long'er's public trial.

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_07: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_07: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_07: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_07: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_07: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_07: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_07: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_07: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_07: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_07: We'll take these.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_07: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_07: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_07: When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_07: just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_07: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_07: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_07: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_07: But that's wood.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_07: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_07: So let's get that metal.

471
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:12,570
SPEAKER_07: The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:15,900
SPEAKER_07: You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,510
SPEAKER_07: and after that...

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_07: they captured two mountains a day.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_07: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_07: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_07: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_07: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,219
SPEAKER_07: Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_07: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_07: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_07: The District Chief has come.

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_07: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_07: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_07: How can I ever make it up?

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_07: Everyone knows about them.

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_07: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_07: Classic feudal types.

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_07: Do as Chairman Mao says.

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_07: Let's not bring up the past.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_07: Fetch a brazier.

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_07: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

764
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,449
SPEAKER_07: Comrade Wan Erxi's here.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_07: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_07: Solid working class stock.

773
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,890
SPEAKER_07: Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
SPEAKER_07: Where's Fengxia?

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_07: Comrade Fengxia.

786
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:36,689
SPEAKER_07: Let's go.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399
SPEAKER_07: Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_07: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_07: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_07: What are these eggs for?

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_07: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_07: So we've got to get going.

1011
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,899
SPEAKER_07: - But you won't stay?
- No, thanks.

1012
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:00,090
SPEAKER_07: Never mind. Let's go. Don't worry.

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_07: What's happened?

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_07: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_07: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_07: I have to confess my crimes.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_07: I have faith in the Party.

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_07: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_07: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_07: Go now, I'll be okay.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_07: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!
