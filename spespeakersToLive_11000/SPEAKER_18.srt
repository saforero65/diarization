163
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,400
SPEAKER_18: Mr. Xu, any mistakes?

703
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,739
SPEAKER_18: I will remember.

813
01:31:06,489 --> 01:31:08,079
SPEAKER_18: Aren't you busy!

814
01:31:08,659 --> 01:31:10,680
SPEAKER_18: I brought some colleagues.

815
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,779
SPEAKER_18: We're fixing the place up.

816
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,960
SPEAKER_18: We replaced the roof tiles...

867
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,479
SPEAKER_18: Dad, Mom...

868
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,409
SPEAKER_18: I'm taking Fengxia.

869
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:40,649
SPEAKER_18: I'll look after her.

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,329
SPEAKER_18: Really?

913
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:28,000
SPEAKER_18: I just came from the hospital.
The doctor says it's due in autumn.

919
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:53,890
SPEAKER_18: That she's in terrific shape.

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,119
SPEAKER_18: He was very busy?

943
01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:24,050
SPEAKER_18: Dad, I saw Chunsheng yesterday.

944
01:43:25,989 --> 01:43:28,829
SPEAKER_18: He's been arrested as a capitalist.

945
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,829
SPEAKER_18: They held a public trial against him.

946
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,930
SPEAKER_18: We have to draw a line between us and him.

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_18: All my debts will have been paid.

1030
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:08,390
SPEAKER_18: Everything's fine and normal.

1031
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:12,460
SPEAKER_18: They say she's great. No problems.

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_18: From the contractions, not right now.

1034
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:23,710
SPEAKER_18: Fengxia, don't be nervous.

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
SPEAKER_18: Comrade, are there any doctors?

1062
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,159
SPEAKER_18: Yes, us!

1063
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,399
SPEAKER_18: I mean, older ones.

1071
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,239
SPEAKER_18: Have to get one out.

1072
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,710
SPEAKER_18: Let me think.

1076
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,359
SPEAKER_18: me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1086
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,289
SPEAKER_18: That's professor Wang...

1087
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,229
SPEAKER_18: head of obstetrics.

1088
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,029
SPEAKER_18: Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,760
SPEAKER_18: If you get a car from the factory...

1162
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,399
SPEAKER_18: we can drive Fengxia home.

1166
02:00:00,789 --> 02:00:02,380
SPEAKER_18: What's with him?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_18: He ate too quickly.

1171
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:28,539
SPEAKER_18: You two get the car, we'll be fine.

1262
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:44,180
SPEAKER_18: Not just buns...

1263
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:46,310
SPEAKER_18: anything made from wheat.

1267
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:21,010
SPEAKER_18: No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.

1268
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:24,510
SPEAKER_18: Little Bun, behave yourself.
