SPEAKER_23: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_23: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_23: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_23: Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_23: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

289
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,220
SPEAKER_23: The wounded who froze to death.

290
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,420
SPEAKER_23: Put it on. We must survive.

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_23: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_23: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,589
SPEAKER_23: They've all run off.

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
SPEAKER_23: How could that be?

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_23: The Reds must be on the attack.

331
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,849
SPEAKER_23: Where did you find this coat?

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_23: The coat's from my brother's unit.

334
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,360
SPEAKER_23: - What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

449
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:49,050
SPEAKER_23: It's ready.

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_23: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

575
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,690
SPEAKER_23: We've smelted our steel...

576
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,989
SPEAKER_23: and reached our production target.

577
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:54,500
SPEAKER_23: We're off to report the good news.

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_23: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_23: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_23: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_23: They'll all go to Taiwan!

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_23: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_23: and the last in the toilet!

589
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,880
SPEAKER_23: He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

639
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:58,420
SPEAKER_23: Fugui, listen to me.

640
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:02,430
SPEAKER_23: We have to try and bear it,
even in the worst of times.

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_23: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_23: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_23: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_23: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_23: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_23: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_23: Let her go!

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,869
SPEAKER_23: Comrade Wan Erxi.

812
01:30:33,149 --> 01:30:35,180
SPEAKER_23: Don't forget your package!

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_23: Let's sing a song!

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
SPEAKER_23: Time to wrap up.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
