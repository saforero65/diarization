91
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:48,870
SPEAKER_10: Mr. Long'er says
if you're busy he'll take a rain check.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
SPEAKER_10: No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,779
SPEAKER_10: This is the last time, okay? I promise.

256
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,769
SPEAKER_10: Might never go home again.

257
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,220
SPEAKER_10: What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,890
SPEAKER_10: Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,130
SPEAKER_10: The Nationalists will shoot you.

260
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,470
SPEAKER_10: Besides...

261
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,859
SPEAKER_10: troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,569
SPEAKER_10: If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
SPEAKER_10: But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,410
SPEAKER_10: Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,259
SPEAKER_10: As for me...

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,599
SPEAKER_10: if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,859
SPEAKER_10: Chunsheng, you really are mad.

278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_10: What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_10: What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,549
SPEAKER_10: The wounded.

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
SPEAKER_10: No one's left.

284
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,119
SPEAKER_10: Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

291
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,089
SPEAKER_10: Lao Quan, have a drink.

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_10: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_10: Besides, we're from the same town.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_10: The Reds send POWs home.

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_10: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_10: How do you like my singing?

673
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,159
SPEAKER_10: I meant to call...

686
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,489
SPEAKER_10: Take this for now.

688
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:07,520
SPEAKER_10: Tell me what else I can do.

702
01:20:56,909 --> 01:20:58,539
SPEAKER_10: I owe you a life.

873
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:45,880
SPEAKER_10: Congratulations on Fengxia's wedding.

874
01:37:46,289 --> 01:37:48,760
SPEAKER_10: - When did you get here?
- A while ago.

875
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:52,149
SPEAKER_10: But there were so many people,
I didn't come in.

950
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,430
SPEAKER_10: Fugui!

951
01:44:11,369 --> 01:44:12,770
SPEAKER_10: Who's there?

959
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:09,489
SPEAKER_10: Well?

960
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,329
SPEAKER_10: Fugui...

961
01:45:12,329 --> 01:45:15,060
SPEAKER_10: I've always felt terrible about Youqing.

962
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,300
SPEAKER_10: I've often tried to give you money.
You'd never accept it.

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
SPEAKER_10: It's all in this account. Take it.

965
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,819
SPEAKER_10: Take this...

966
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,420
SPEAKER_10: and my heart will be at ease.

969
01:45:47,529 --> 01:45:49,869
SPEAKER_10: Yesterday, my wife killed herself.

990
01:47:11,619 --> 01:47:13,449
SPEAKER_10: I don't think I can.

995
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:32,039
SPEAKER_10: I snuck out just now...

996
01:47:32,109 --> 01:47:33,899
SPEAKER_10: and better get back.

997
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:44,350
SPEAKER_10: Chunsheng, remember...

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_10: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_10: Let me wear it!
