95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_12: It's settled.

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_12: This can't be happening!

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_12: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_12: We'll settle everything then.

150
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,929
SPEAKER_12: Okay?

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_12: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_12: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_12: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_12: I'll look after her for a few days?

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_12: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

521
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,989
SPEAKER_12: How could you?

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_12: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
SPEAKER_12: Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,909
SPEAKER_12: Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,599
SPEAKER_12: come see the show.

547
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_12: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909
SPEAKER_12: He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:25,420
SPEAKER_12: and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
SPEAKER_12: I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,139
SPEAKER_12: Far away, we flee with haste

552
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,710
SPEAKER_12: Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_12: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_12: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_12: Hold your little Red Books.

858
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,180
SPEAKER_12: Clear a path! Ship sailing through!

859
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,250
SPEAKER_12: Let's get the whole family.

860
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:55,979
SPEAKER_12: The ship of revolution! Advance
through the storm with Chairman Mao!

958
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,819
SPEAKER_12: It'll just take a minute.

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_12: We'll see them soon.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_12: Good idea.
