281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_00: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_00: No one's looking after them?

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_00: Was it from some dead officer?

306
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,599
SPEAKER_00: Home!

307
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,769
SPEAKER_00: Home?

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
SPEAKER_00: Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_00: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_00: and you'll be shot.

311
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,550
SPEAKER_00: Better to wait and become a POW.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_00: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_00: You want to go home, don't run.

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_00: How?

319
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,940
SPEAKER_00: This will do the trick?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_00: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_00: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_00: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_00: Just put those hands up.
