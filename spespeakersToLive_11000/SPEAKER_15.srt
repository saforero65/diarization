53
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,949
SPEAKER_15: Little bastards from big bastards grow.

54
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,519
SPEAKER_15: I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,360
SPEAKER_15: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_15: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

59
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,939
SPEAKER_15: Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_15: He's just singing to himself.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
SPEAKER_15: Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_15: What happened? No one's left?

335
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,730
SPEAKER_15: What's your brother look like?

336
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,269
SPEAKER_15: Just like me.

514
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,969
SPEAKER_15: - Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:17,269
SPEAKER_15: - Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,039
SPEAKER_15: - I'm telling you to go!
- No!

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_15: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_15: Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_15: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610
SPEAKER_15: You, looking after us! After all these years.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_15: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_15: Say I want him to.

569
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,360
SPEAKER_15: Youqing, is that tea for me?

570
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,329
SPEAKER_15: Good boy, bring it over here.

591
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,359
SPEAKER_15: Xia, Youqing, have some dumplings.

680
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,689
SPEAKER_15: I had only one son!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_15: And you killed him!

720
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,140
SPEAKER_15: Sit here.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
SPEAKER_15: You have to get rid of those puppets.

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_15: Do stay! Come on inside.

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_15: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_15: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.
