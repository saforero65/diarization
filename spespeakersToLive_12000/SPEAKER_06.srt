54
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,519
SPEAKER_06: I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,360
SPEAKER_06: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_06: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

59
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,939
SPEAKER_06: Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_06: He's just singing to himself.

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_06: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_06: It's not good for the baby.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
SPEAKER_06: No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,779
SPEAKER_06: This is the last time, okay? I promise.

97
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,529
SPEAKER_06: get a rickshaw to take my wife home. I'm...

98
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,389
SPEAKER_06: Of course.

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_06: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_06: Get out of my sight!

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_06: You can't just win and walk away.

130
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,330
SPEAKER_06: The game's not over yet!

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_06: Youqing, excellent.

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_06: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_06: Jiazhen came back with him.

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_06: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_06: What happened? No one's left?

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_06: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_06: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_06: She can't even say "Daddy."

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_06: You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_06: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_06: He burnt it?

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_06: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_06: that'd have been me.

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_06: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_06: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_06: You can leave those.

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_06: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_06: We're off to the next house.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_06: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_06: Do you expect me to believe that?

521
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,989
SPEAKER_06: How could you?

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_06: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_06: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_06: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_06: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_06: You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_06: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_06: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_06: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_06: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_06: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_06: Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_06: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610
SPEAKER_06: You, looking after us! After all these years.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_06: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_06: Say I want him to.

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_06: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_06: How do you like my singing?

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_06: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_06: our lives will get better and better.

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_06: You can't keep them. Burn them!

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_06: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_06: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_06: No, really.

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_06: From where?

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_06: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_06: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_06: Do stay! Come on inside.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_06: Erxi painted this.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_06: "The working class leads us all."

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
SPEAKER_06: Come on, you can't cry today.

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_06: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_06: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_06: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_06: Don't go. The tea's ready.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_06: Better when you come over.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_06: No wonder there's a bottle!

936
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,920
SPEAKER_06: This is great.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_06: Just say what you want.

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_06: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_06: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_06: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_06: Can't you see?

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_06: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_06: You, a capitalist?

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_06: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_06: Okay, we're going.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_06: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
SPEAKER_06: Where's Erxi?

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_06: How's Fengxia?

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_06: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_06: We'll see them soon.

1157
01:59:32,659 --> 01:59:35,289
SPEAKER_06: - How is he?
- They're both fine!

1158
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:37,689
SPEAKER_06: Erxi, you're a lucky man!

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_06: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_06: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_06: Careful, it's hot.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_06: What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_06: He gobbled up seven buns.

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_06: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_06: I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_06: Take the medicine to Granny.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_06: Have you had your medicine?

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_06: Are you happy?
