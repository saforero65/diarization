86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_07: My luck's changed.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_07: Write that down. Another round.

118
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,690
SPEAKER_07: You've lost everything.

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_07: What do you mean?

159
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,179
SPEAKER_07: Master Fugui, I'll take you.

164
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,269
SPEAKER_07: No, Fugui's signature is on each one.

165
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:42,950
SPEAKER_07: Long'er, is our Xu family home...

166
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,650
SPEAKER_07: enough to settle Fugui's debt?

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_07: Life won't be easy.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_07: Great at any price.

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_07: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

256
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,769
SPEAKER_07: Might never go home again.

257
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,220
SPEAKER_07: What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,890
SPEAKER_07: Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,130
SPEAKER_07: The Nationalists will shoot you.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_07: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_07: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

319
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,940
SPEAKER_07: This will do the trick?

324
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,940
SPEAKER_07: - The attack hasn't started.
- Let's put them down.

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_07: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_07: we've got to make it back alive.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_07: Fengxia!

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_07: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_07: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_07: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_07: They shot him.

427
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,730
SPEAKER_07: Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,070
SPEAKER_07: Ordinary townspeople.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_07: Better dry it out fast.

523
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:49,469
SPEAKER_07: That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,239
SPEAKER_07: I tried to stop you.

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_07: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_07: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_07: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_07: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_07: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_07: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_07: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_07: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_07: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_07: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_07: That's good.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_07: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_07: The sheep will turn into an ox.

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_07: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_07: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

671
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,670
SPEAKER_07: - He's already here.
- Tell him to go.

673
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,159
SPEAKER_07: I meant to call...

674
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,930
SPEAKER_07: after I settled in.

675
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:07,930
SPEAKER_07: Fugui...

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,699
SPEAKER_07: how could it be your son?

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_07: You're the District Chief?

686
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,489
SPEAKER_07: Take this for now.

688
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:07,520
SPEAKER_07: Tell me what else I can do.

697
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,779
SPEAKER_07: District Chief, let's go.

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_07: I think you should go, Chief.

702
01:20:56,909 --> 01:20:58,539
SPEAKER_07: I owe you a life.

703
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,739
SPEAKER_07: I will remember.

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_07: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_07: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_07: How dare you!

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_07: Don't you see what they are?

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_07: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_07: Classic feudal types.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_07: I've found just the man for her.

749
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:34,750
SPEAKER_07: He works in a factory in the county seat.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
SPEAKER_07: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_07: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_07: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_07: He's also got a handicap...

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_07: Yes, and run if he has to.

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_07: Erxi is good with his hands.

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_07: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_07: We're happy if you are.

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_07: Anytime. You decide.

873
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:45,880
SPEAKER_07: Congratulations on Fengxia's wedding.

874
01:37:46,289 --> 01:37:48,760
SPEAKER_07: - When did you get here?
- A while ago.

875
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:52,149
SPEAKER_07: But there were so many people,
I didn't come in.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_07: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_07: You can't go on avoiding him.

958
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,819
SPEAKER_07: It'll just take a minute.

962
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,300
SPEAKER_07: I've often tried to give you money.
You'd never accept it.

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
SPEAKER_07: It's all in this account. Take it.

966
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,420
SPEAKER_07: and my heart will be at ease.

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_07: All my debts will have been paid.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_07: What do you mean?

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_07: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_07: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_07: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_07: I don't want to live anymore!

990
01:47:11,619 --> 01:47:13,449
SPEAKER_07: I don't think I can.

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,659
SPEAKER_07: Yes, come in.

994
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,199
SPEAKER_07: No, thank you, I've got to go.

995
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:32,039
SPEAKER_07: I snuck out just now...

996
01:47:32,109 --> 01:47:33,899
SPEAKER_07: and better get back.

997
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:44,350
SPEAKER_07: Chunsheng, remember...

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_07: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_07: Time does fly!

1081
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,909
SPEAKER_07: To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_07: Let me wear it!

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_07: Can we see them?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_07: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,579
SPEAKER_07: Some water should help.
