687
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,520

SPEAKER_08: They say she's great. No problems.

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_08: From the contractions, not right now.

1034
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:23,710
SPEAKER_08: Fengxia, don't be nervous.

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
SPEAKER_08: Comrade, are there any doctors?

1062

01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,359
SPEAKER_08: me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1086
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,289

1088
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,029
SPEAKER_08: Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.

1089
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:19,439
SPEAKER_08: I was putting on a show.

1090
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,699
SPEAKER_08: We're not accusing you.

1091
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:23,770
SPEAKER_08: My wife's having a baby.

1092
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,350
SPEAKER_08: I wanted you here for her sake.

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,760
SPEAKER_08: If you get a car from the factory...

1162
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,399
SPEAKER_08: we can drive Fengxia home.

1166
02:00:00,789 --> 02:00:02,380
SPEAKER_08: What's with him?

1171
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:28,539
SPEAKER_08: You two get the car, we'll be fine.

1231
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,029
SPEAKER_08: We should've bought them
on the way home.

1232
02:05:50,539 --> 02:05:52,659
SPEAKER_08: Now we've got to carry them!

1253
02:07:11,979 --> 02:07:13,350
SPEAKER_08: It's okay.

1262
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:44,180
SPEAKER_08: Not just buns...

1263
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:46,310
SPEAKER_08: anything made from wheat.

1266
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,979
SPEAKER_08: - I'll make dinner.

1267
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:21,010
