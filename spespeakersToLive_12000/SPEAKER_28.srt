114
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,850
SPEAKER_28: Go!

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,720
SPEAKER_28: Let's roll!

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_28: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

140
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,769
SPEAKER_28: I am very sorry, but you've got nothing left.

141
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,779
SPEAKER_28: What could you stake the bet on?
We don't accept empty bets.

142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
SPEAKER_28: I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480
SPEAKER_28: Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_28: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

146
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,529
SPEAKER_28: We'll formalize the transfer in a few days...

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,289
SPEAKER_28: and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_28: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_28: We'll settle everything then.

313
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,460
SPEAKER_28: So, no running?

334
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,360
SPEAKER_28: - What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_28: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_28: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_28: What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_28: What is this?

500
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,320
SPEAKER_28: Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_28: This is too much.

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_28: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_28: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_28: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_28: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_28: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_28: That kid could not dream that up.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_28: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_28: Let her go!

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_28: Are you mad?

799
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:00,890
SPEAKER_28: Comrade, could I look at that one?

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_28: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_28: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

863
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:17,989
SPEAKER_28: Chairman Mao...

864
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:21,600
SPEAKER_28: Comrade Fengxia's mine now.

897
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,279
SPEAKER_28: Dad! Mom!

1042
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:54,829
SPEAKER_28: Do as Mommy says and push.

1043
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:56,640
SPEAKER_28: Everything will be fine.

1078
01:53:31,029 --> 01:53:33,159
SPEAKER_28: We dragged him here today...

1079
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,270
SPEAKER_28: to educate him, to criticize him...

1080
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,899
SPEAKER_28: and to let him witness her giving birth.

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_28: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_28: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_28: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?
