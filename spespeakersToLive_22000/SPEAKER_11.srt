115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,720
SPEAKER_11: Let's roll!

136
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,110
SPEAKER_11: It's not over yet!

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_11: Sit down.

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_11: - Sit.

142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
SPEAKER_11: I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480
SPEAKER_11: Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_11: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_11: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_11: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_11: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_11: Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_11: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_11: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_11: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_11: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_11: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_11: What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_11: What is this?

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_11: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_11: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_11: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_11: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_11: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_11: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_11: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_11: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_11: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_11: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530

01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_11: Daddy.

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_11: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_11: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_11: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_11: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_11: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_11: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_11: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_11: No!

714
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:07,439
SPEAKER_11: The 1960s

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_11: You can't keep them. Burn them!

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,869
SPEAKER_11: Comrade Wan Erxi.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_11: Let's sing a song!

845
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:05,659
SPEAKER_11: Nothing compares
to the Party's benevolence

846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,229
SPEAKER_11: Chairman Mao is dearer
than father and mother

847
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:18,739
SPEAKER_11: There's nothing as good as socialism

848
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,609
SPEAKER_11: No ocean as deep as class feeling

849
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,680
SPEAKER_11: Maoist Thought
is revolution's treasure trove

850
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:34,630
SPEAKER_11: Whoever opposes it, we take as our enemy

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
SPEAKER_11: Come on, you can't cry today.

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_11: Hold your little Red Books.

898
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,470

01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,359
SPEAKER_11: How vile can you get?

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_11: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_11: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_11: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,760
SPEAKER_11: If you get a car from the factory...

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_11: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_11: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_11: But he was okay after the water.
