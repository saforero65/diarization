557
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,500
SPEAKER_29: Well?

558
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,300

566
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:36,710

1046
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:06,250
SPEAKER_29: Go wait in the corridor.

1064
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:06,930

We've overthrown them.

1065
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:10,609
SPEAKER_29: Relax. Your wife's fine. We can handle this.

1137
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,310

1153
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:23,270

02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,960
SPEAKER_29: He'll know.

1209
02:04:30,189 --> 02:04:32,680
SPEAKER_29: Grandpa! It's crooked again.

1213
02:04:45,739 --> 02:04:47,800
SPEAKER_29: Granny, your medicine.

1214
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:49,770
SPEAKER_29: Back already?

1215
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,569

1216
02:04:52,109 --> 02:04:54,579
SPEAKER_29: I delivered 10 thermoses of water.

1223

1235
02:05:59,909 --> 02:06:02,470
SPEAKER_29: Grandpa, where will the chicks live?

1238
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:27,729

1239
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:29,800
SPEAKER_29: Fengxia looks at photos.

1240
02:06:30,439 --> 02:06:33,710
SPEAKER_29: Little Bun, do you know who Youqing is?

1244
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,779
SPEAKER_29: Granny, why all the photos for Fengxia?

1269
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:28,789
SPEAKER_29: Grandpa, where'll we put the chicks?

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_29: Let's see.

1276
02:09:05,329 --> 02:09:08,060
