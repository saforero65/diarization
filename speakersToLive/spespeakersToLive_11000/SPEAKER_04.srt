29
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,080
SPEAKER_04: Business is good, Mr. Xie.

30
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,020
SPEAKER_04: Come often. You're always welcome.

62
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,319
SPEAKER_04: You're up.

63
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,970
SPEAKER_04: What's wrong?

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_04: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_04: Fugui...

78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,819
SPEAKER_04: Can't rush these things.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,089
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_04: You can't just win and walk away.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_04: Youqing, excellent.

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_04: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_04: Which corpses?

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_04: It really is booze!

324
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,940
SPEAKER_04: - The attack hasn't started.
- Let's put them down.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_04: And live a good life.

337
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,019
SPEAKER_04: Lao Quan!

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_04: I thought of you...

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_04: You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_04: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_04: He burnt it?

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_04: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_04: You have to go smelt steel.

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_04: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_04: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_04: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_04: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_04: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_04: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_04: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_04: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_04: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_04: our lives will get better and better.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_04: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_04: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_04: The sheep will turn into an ox.

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_04: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_04: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_04: From where?

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_04: Don't go. The tea's ready.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_04: But it's Chairman Mao.

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_04: On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_04: Better when you come over.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_04: No wonder there's a bottle!

936
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,920
SPEAKER_04: This is great.

953
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:16,640
SPEAKER_04: Who?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_04: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_04: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_04: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_04: Have you seen her body?

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_04: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_04: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_04: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_04: I don't want to live anymore!

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_04: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_04: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_04: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_04: Okay, we're going.

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_04: Careful, it's hot.

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_04: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_04: I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_04: Take the medicine to Granny.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_04: Have you had your medicine?

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_04: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_04: give me a hand.

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_04: Are you happy?

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_04: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_04: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_04: Let's see.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_04: And soon they'll grow up.
