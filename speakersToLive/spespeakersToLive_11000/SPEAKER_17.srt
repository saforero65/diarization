00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,529
SPEAKER_17: get a rickshaw to take my wife home. I'm...

98
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,389
SPEAKER_17: Of course.

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_17: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_17: Get out of my sight!

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_17: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_17: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_17: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_17: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_17: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_17: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_17: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_17: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_17: we've got to make it back alive.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_17: Fengxia!

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_17: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_17: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_17: She can't even say "Daddy."

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_17: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699

00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_17: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_17: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_17: that'd have been me.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_17: What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_17: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_17: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_17: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_17: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_17: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_17: Better dry it out fast.

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_17: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_17: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

780
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,920
SPEAKER_17: I'll be going.

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_17: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_17: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_17: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_17: Jiazhen, make some tea.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_17: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_17: But here's boiled water.

916
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:38,680
SPEAKER_17: Cheers!

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_17: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_17: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_17: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

955
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:24,779
SPEAKER_17: What do you want?

956
01:44:26,949 --> 01:44:28,850
SPEAKER_17: Come out for a second.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_17: Just say what you want.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_17: You came for this?

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_17: What do you mean?

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_17: You mustn't lose hope.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_17: Can't you see?

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_17: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_17: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,659
SPEAKER_17: Yes, come in.

994
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,199
SPEAKER_17: No, thank you, I've got to go.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_17: You, a capitalist?

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_17: Everyone knows you.

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_17: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_17: He's all right.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
SPEAKER_17: Where's Erxi?

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_17: How's Fengxia?

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_17: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_17: Take your time. There's plenty.

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_17: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_17: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_17: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_17: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_17: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_17: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_17: How about in here?
