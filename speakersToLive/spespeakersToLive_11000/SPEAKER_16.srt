00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_16: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_16: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_16: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_16: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_16: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_16: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_16: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_16: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_16: We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_16: Fugui, you're back just in time...

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_16: It can't be worth much.

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_16: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_16: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_16: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_16: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_16: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_16: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_16: Wake up.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_16: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_16: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_16: is like a little chicken.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_16: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_16: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_16: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_16: Put these old things to new use.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_16: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_16: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_16: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_16: We'll discuss it later.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_16: He can run?

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_16: "The working class leads us all."

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_16: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_16: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_16: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_16: Don't be like that.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_16: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_16: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_16: Can't we put this behind us?

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_16: If only Youqing had been here today.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
SPEAKER_16: I'll be going.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_16: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_16: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_16: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_16: And will be better for your child.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_16: Erxi, drink up.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_16: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_16: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_16: you've got to bear it!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_16: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_16: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_16: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_16: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_16: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_16: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_16: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_16: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_16: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_16: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_16: I'll go buy some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_16: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_16: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_16: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_16: to think of a name for the kid?

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_16: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_16: What name do you like?

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_16: You just say anything!

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_16: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_16: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_16: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_16: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_16: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_16: I'll make lunch.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_16: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_16: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_16: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_16: He's a professor, after all.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_16: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_16: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_16: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_16: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_16: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_16: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_16: Rice costs more than wheat.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_16: Then they'll eat more.

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_16: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_16: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_16: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_16: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_16: and life will get better and better.
