36
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:11,100
SPEAKER_14: Long'er, you're nearly there.

37
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,800
SPEAKER_14: One more night like this...

38
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:19,209
SPEAKER_14: you'll have him right where you want him.

39
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,100
SPEAKER_14: Sure there's no mistake?

40
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,579
SPEAKER_14: Look at the records.

41
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,220
SPEAKER_14: Master Fugui is going home. You take him.

85
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,759
SPEAKER_14: Your win, Master Fugui.

88
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,080
SPEAKER_14: Master Fugui, your wife's here.

89
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,059
SPEAKER_14: What are you doing here?

90
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,250
SPEAKER_14: Well?

99
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,909
SPEAKER_14: Master Fugui, you lost.

100
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,590
SPEAKER_14: Let's roll!

101
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,990
SPEAKER_14: Master Fugui.

116
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,649
SPEAKER_14: Well?

117
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,360
SPEAKER_14: Master Fugui, you're out of the game.

118
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,690
SPEAKER_14: You've lost everything.

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_14: What do you mean?

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
SPEAKER_14: You bet your property.
It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,110
SPEAKER_14: You don't have a roof tile to your name.

122
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,090
SPEAKER_14: What is it?

123
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,620
SPEAKER_14: Master Fugui must settle his account.

176
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,250
SPEAKER_14: Fugui.

268
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:43,619
SPEAKER_14: I'd die happy if I could drive.

304
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,130
SPEAKER_14: What?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
SPEAKER_14: - Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

672
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,609
SPEAKER_14: It's me, Chunsheng.

776
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,909
SPEAKER_14: Good.

819
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:25,270
SPEAKER_14: Fengxia helped us.

820
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,510
SPEAKER_14: You're just in time. We've just finished.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_14: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

872
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,109
SPEAKER_14: Chunsheng.
