109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330
SPEAKER_26: Get out!

110
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,870
SPEAKER_26: I've just...

111
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,240
SPEAKER_26: Let's play!

114
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,850
SPEAKER_26: Go!

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,720
SPEAKER_26: Let's roll!

135
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,950
SPEAKER_26: What are you doing?

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_26: Sit down.

138
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,919
SPEAKER_26: - Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_26: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170
SPEAKER_26: Take this.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_26: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_26: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_26: We're off to the next house.

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_26: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_26: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_26: What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_26: What is this?

500
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,320
SPEAKER_26: Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_26: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_26: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_26: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_26: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_26: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_26: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_26: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_26: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_26: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_26: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_26: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
SPEAKER_26: I'm talking to you.

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_26: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_26: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_26: You spoil him.

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
SPEAKER_26: Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

699
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:44,560
SPEAKER_26: Go away!

700
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,439
SPEAKER_26: All right.

701
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,340
SPEAKER_26: I'm going.

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_26: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_26: Do you want your jeep?

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_26: You can't keep them. Burn them!

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_26: Erxi painted this.

954
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,039
SPEAKER_26: Chunsheng.

1077
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,359
SPEAKER_26: How vile can you get?

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_26: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1155
01:59:28,289 --> 01:59:29,720
SPEAKER_26: Is it a boy?

1156
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:32,279
SPEAKER_26: Yes, 7.9 pounds!

1157
01:59:32,659 --> 01:59:35,289
SPEAKER_26: - How is he?
- They're both fine!

1158
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:37,689
SPEAKER_26: Erxi, you're a lucky man!

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_26: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1181
02:01:34,449 --> 02:01:36,810
SPEAKER_26: Don't panic. Think of something.

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
SPEAKER_26: He's eaten too much.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_26: What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_26: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_26: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_26: But he was okay after the water.

1194
02:02:15,149 --> 02:02:18,020
SPEAKER_26: It was the water that did it.
