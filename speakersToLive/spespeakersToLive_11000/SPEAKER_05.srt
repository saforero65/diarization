65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_05: It's not good for the baby.

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_05: What are you crying for?

71
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,899
SPEAKER_05: I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_05: My luck's changed.

87

SPEAKER_05: Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,559
SPEAKER_05: What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_05: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

164
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,269
SPEAKER_05: No, Fugui's signature is on each one.

165
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:42,950
SPEAKER_05: Long'er, is our Xu family home...

166
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,650
SPEAKER_05: enough to settle Fugui's debt?

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_05: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_05: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_05: Life won't be easy.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_05: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_05: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

427
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,730
SPEAKER_05: Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,070
SPEAKER_05: Ordinary townspeople.

433
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,699
SPEAKER_05: Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,530
SPEAKER_05: Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_05: You can leave those.

523
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:49,469
SPEAKER_05: That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,239
SPEAKER_05: I tried to stop you.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_05: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_05: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

537
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,380
SPEAKER_05: What do you know?

538
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,150
SPEAKER_05: Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,869
SPEAKER_05: Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,860
SPEAKER_05: I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840
SPEAKER_05: Have I ever complained?

668
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,989
SPEAKER_05: The one who ran over my son?

671
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,670
SPEAKER_05: - He's already here.

674
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,930
SPEAKER_05: after I settled in.

675
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:07,930
SPEAKER_05: Fugui...

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,699
SPEAKER_05: how could it be your son?

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_05: You're the District Chief?

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_05: I think you should go, Chief.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_05: Don't you see what they are?

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_05: I've found just the man for her.

748
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:30,909

SPEAKER_05: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_05: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_05: He's also got a handicap...

754
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,170
SPEAKER_05: a lame leg.

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_05: Yes, and run if he has to.

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
SPEAKER_05: No, it was an accident at work.

760

SPEAKER_05: He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_05: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_05: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_05: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_05: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_05: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_05: No, really.

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_05: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_05: Time does fly!

1023
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:33,449
SPEAKER_05: When will they let you return?

1051
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:29,000

SPEAKER_05: Some water should help.

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_05: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_05: They'll have more room to run around.
