SPEAKER_02: Fugui...

157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,659
SPEAKER_02: If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
SPEAKER_02: I won't let him be like you.

191
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,549

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,739
SPEAKER_02: In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,640

01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,649
SPEAKER_02: Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_02: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_02: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_02: from making you go.

663
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,109
SPEAKER_02: It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_02: If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
SPEAKER_02: I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

666
01:17:51,489 --> 01:17:53,430
SPEAKER_02: Oh, my poor darling.

669
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:32,529
SPEAKER_02: What's he doing here?

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_02: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_02: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,100

697
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,779
