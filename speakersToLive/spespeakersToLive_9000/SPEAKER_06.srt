29
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,080
SPEAKER_06: Business is good, Mr. Xie.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_06: My luck's changed.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_06: Write that down. Another round.

118
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,690
SPEAKER_06: You've lost everything.

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_06: What do you mean?

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_06: You can't just win and walk away.

130
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,330
SPEAKER_06: The game's not over yet!

268
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:43,619
SPEAKER_06: I'd die happy if I could drive.

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_06: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_06: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_06: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_06: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_06: Fengxia!

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_06: I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_06: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_06: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_06: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_06: You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_06: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_06: He burnt it?

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_06: Better dry it out fast.

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_06: It can't be worth much.

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_06: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

599
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,920
SPEAKER_06: He's not going anywhere.
He hasn't slept in days.

600
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,390
SPEAKER_06: Leave him alone.

601
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,899
SPEAKER_06: - The District Chief is coming.
- So?

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_06: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_06: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_06: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_06: Wake up.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_06: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_06: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_06: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,989
SPEAKER_06: Fengxia's mom and dad.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_06: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_06: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_06: Jiazhen, make some tea.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_06: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_06: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_06: Don't go. The tea's ready.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_06: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_06: And will be better for your child.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_06: Of course.

969
01:45:47,529 --> 01:45:49,869
SPEAKER_06: Yesterday, my wife killed herself.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_06: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_06: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_06: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_06: No doctors?

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
SPEAKER_06: Comrade, are there any doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_06: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_06: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
SPEAKER_06: Where's Erxi?

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_06: How's Fengxia?

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_06: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_06: to think of a name for the kid?

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_06: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_06: That's not a name!

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_06: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_06: I'll fix it.

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_06: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_06: give me a hand.

1233
02:05:53,369 --> 02:05:55,399
SPEAKER_06: Careful! Don't drop them!

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_06: Are you happy?

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_06: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_06: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_06: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_06: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_06: He's a professor, after all.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_06: It's much too much.

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_06: Let's see.

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_06: and the geese will turn into sheep...
