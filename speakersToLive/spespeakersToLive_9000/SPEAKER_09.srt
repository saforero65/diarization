174
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,450
SPEAKER_09: Both sides must sign.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_09: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_09: No one's looking after them?

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_09: Was it from some dead officer?

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_09: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_09: Besides, we're from the same town.

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_09: The Reds must be on the attack.

306
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,599
SPEAKER_09: Home!

307
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,769
SPEAKER_09: Home?

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
SPEAKER_09: Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_09: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_09: and you'll be shot.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_09: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_09: You want to go home, don't run.

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_09: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_09: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_09: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_09: Just put those hands up.

380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_09: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_09: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_09: Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,119
SPEAKER_09: He has served in the Liberation Army?

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_09: to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,579
SPEAKER_09: Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,210
SPEAKER_09: What did Long'er do?

394
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:47,449
SPEAKER_09: Because of the family home,
he's been sentenced a landlord.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_09: He refused, beat up a cadre...

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_09: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_09: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_09: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

405
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,429
SPEAKER_09: Of course. You're you, he's him.

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,409
SPEAKER_09: It's all here?

451
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,760
SPEAKER_09: Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,619
SPEAKER_09: To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_09: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_09: We'll take these.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_09: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_09: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_09: When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_09: just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_09: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_09: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_09: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_09: But that's wood.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_09: We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
SPEAKER_09: It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_09: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_09: So let's get that metal.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_09: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_09: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_09: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_09: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_09: How do you like my singing?

718
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,710
SPEAKER_09: - You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_09: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

720
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,140
SPEAKER_09: Sit here.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
SPEAKER_09: You have to get rid of those puppets.

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_09: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

730
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,119
SPEAKER_09: Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,760
SPEAKER_09: "The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_09: Do as Chairman Mao says.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_09: Fetch a brazier.

738
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,609
SPEAKER_09: Fugui...

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_09: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_09: to get you a better job. What do you think?

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_09: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

745
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,390
SPEAKER_09: I'll tell you about him.

746
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,100
SPEAKER_09: Let's not let her in on it for now.

765
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,420
SPEAKER_09: Comrade Wan Erxi.

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_09: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_09: Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_09: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_09: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_09: So we've got to get going.

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_09: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_09: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_09: I have to confess my crimes.

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_09: Everyone knows you.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_09: I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_09: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_09: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_09: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_09: Go now, I'll be okay.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_09: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!
