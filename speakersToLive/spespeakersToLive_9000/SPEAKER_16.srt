43
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,319
SPEAKER_16: Take care, Master.

44
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,350
SPEAKER_16: Welcome home, sir.

45
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,620
SPEAKER_16: Dad!

46
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,660
SPEAKER_16: Degenerate! Another night gambling!

66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,149
SPEAKER_16: You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

67
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
SPEAKER_16: Who was gambling? I went to watch.

71
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,899
SPEAKER_16: I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

74
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,879
SPEAKER_16: I've said all there is to say.

75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,009
SPEAKER_16: Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,110
SPEAKER_16: It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
SPEAKER_16: Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

80
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,459
SPEAKER_16: Please.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,689
SPEAKER_16: I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,470
SPEAKER_16: Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,700
SPEAKER_16: Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,509
SPEAKER_16: Tell me.

103
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,980
SPEAKER_16: Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,919
SPEAKER_16: Come home.

114
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,850
SPEAKER_16: Go!

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,720
SPEAKER_16: Let's roll!

151
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,649
SPEAKER_16: Your wife's been waiting for ages.

152
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,620
SPEAKER_16: Fugui...

153
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,960
SPEAKER_16: I just wanted to tell you...

154
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,360
SPEAKER_16: I've realized...

155
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,340
SPEAKER_16: you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,600
SPEAKER_16: I'm taking Fengxia with me.

157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,659
SPEAKER_16: If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
SPEAKER_16: I won't let him be like you.

160
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,860
SPEAKER_16: - What are you doing?
- Master Fugui.

161
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,710
SPEAKER_16: I have nothing left.

162
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,220
SPEAKER_16: 63, 73, 83...

166
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,650
SPEAKER_16: enough to settle Fugui's debt?

190
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,480
SPEAKER_16: Needles and threads for sale!

191
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,549
SPEAKER_16: Granny!

192
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,049
SPEAKER_16: Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,450
SPEAKER_16: Jiazhen.

194
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,549
SPEAKER_16: Come look at your son.

195
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,990
SPEAKER_16: He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_16: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_16: What's his name?

198
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,789
SPEAKER_16: "Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,730
SPEAKER_16: He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,329
SPEAKER_16: Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,759
SPEAKER_16: Me.

202
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,509
SPEAKER_16: Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,509
SPEAKER_16: I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
SPEAKER_16: I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,450
SPEAKER_16: Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,619
SPEAKER_16: I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

208
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,160
SPEAKER_16: Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

212
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,009
SPEAKER_16: and live peacefully.

218
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,569
SPEAKER_16: Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,279
SPEAKER_16: but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,140
SPEAKER_16: We'll work something out.

221
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
SPEAKER_16: I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

223
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,579
SPEAKER_16: Don't say that.

224
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,509
SPEAKER_16: All I ask is a quiet life together.

251
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,880
SPEAKER_16: Come out!

252
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,289
SPEAKER_16: Come on! Get a move on!

253
00:28:56,589 --> 00:29:00,589
SPEAKER_16: 1949: Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army
is losing the civil war.

254
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,529
SPEAKER_16: The Communists under Mao Zedong
are poised to take over China.

255
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,670
SPEAKER_16: So we're fighting the Communists.

271
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,269
SPEAKER_16: One, two, three. One, two, three.

325
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,059
SPEAKER_16: Chunsheng!

339
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:42,130
SPEAKER_16: wounded me

340
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:50,599
SPEAKER_16: I gather my troops

341
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:04,210
SPEAKER_16: and we run for our lives

352
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,920
SPEAKER_16: She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,849
SPEAKER_16: kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,570
SPEAKER_16: You should have written.

361
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,659
SPEAKER_16: and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,489
SPEAKER_16: I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,929
SPEAKER_16: Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,519
SPEAKER_16: The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,789
SPEAKER_16: It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,199
SPEAKER_16: They never get...

367
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,869
SPEAKER_16: a good night's sleep.

371
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,449
SPEAKER_16: In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,019
SPEAKER_16: For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,260
SPEAKER_16: No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,849
SPEAKER_16: When the fever came down...

375
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,059
SPEAKER_16: she'd lost her voice.

376
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,460
SPEAKER_16: You're here.

377
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,000
SPEAKER_16: Fugui's back.

378
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:52,429
SPEAKER_16: This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

379
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,400
SPEAKER_16: So you're our leading cadre.

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_16: That's taking part.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_16: The government wanted part of the house.

404
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,150
SPEAKER_16: Counterrevolutionary timber.

415
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,500
SPEAKER_16: What's wrong?

416
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
SPEAKER_16: Why are your pants wet?

419
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,510
SPEAKER_16: They shot Long'er?

427
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,730
SPEAKER_16: Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,070
SPEAKER_16: Ordinary townspeople.

433
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,699
SPEAKER_16: Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,530
SPEAKER_16: Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,800
SPEAKER_16: Of course.

436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,969
SPEAKER_16: Poor townspeople.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_16: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,579
SPEAKER_16: Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,050
SPEAKER_16: I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,719
SPEAKER_16: Good idea!

441
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,400
SPEAKER_16: The 1950s

442
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,840
SPEAKER_16: 1958: Mao Zedong launches
the "Great Leap Forward."

443
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:08,710
SPEAKER_16: Steel production is now targeted
at 10.7 million tonnes per year.

444
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,309
SPEAKER_16: Every household donates its iron utensils.

445
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:32,010
SPEAKER_16: Take a break.

449
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:49,050
SPEAKER_16: It's ready.

455
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:06,710
SPEAKER_16: If you take all our pots away,
how will we cook?

471
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:12,570
SPEAKER_16: The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:15,900
SPEAKER_16: You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,510
SPEAKER_16: and after that...

484
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,659
SPEAKER_16: - Enough?
- No!

485
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,530
SPEAKER_16: Enough?

486
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,690
SPEAKER_16: Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

494
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:32,409
SPEAKER_16: Give it to us if you can't finish.

495
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:07,630
SPEAKER_16: What the hell are you doing?

523
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:49,469
SPEAKER_16: That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,239
SPEAKER_16: I tried to stop you.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_16: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_16: Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_16: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610
SPEAKER_16: You, looking after us! After all these years.

537
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,380
SPEAKER_16: What do you know?

538
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,150
SPEAKER_16: Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,869
SPEAKER_16: Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,860
SPEAKER_16: I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840
SPEAKER_16: Have I ever complained?

542
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,780
SPEAKER_16: Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,420
SPEAKER_16: Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909
SPEAKER_16: He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:25,420
SPEAKER_16: and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
SPEAKER_16: I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,139
SPEAKER_16: Far away, we flee with haste

552
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,710
SPEAKER_16: Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

559
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,750
SPEAKER_16: Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,110
SPEAKER_16: Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,409
SPEAKER_16: Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,599
SPEAKER_16: Take him tea full of vinegar.

563
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,869
SPEAKER_16: That will teach him.

566
01:04:34,949 --> 01:04:36,710
SPEAKER_16: Should we add chili?

567
01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:40,820
SPEAKER_16: Good, it'll be hot and sour soup.

602
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,760
SPEAKER_16: A kid still has to sleep.

608
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,390
SPEAKER_16: Come on, get up.

609
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,159
SPEAKER_16: Your classmates are already on their way.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_16: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_16: Have 20. You should eat more.

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_16: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

640
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:02,430
SPEAKER_16: We have to try and bear it,
even in the worst of times.

644
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:44,539
SPEAKER_16: Take the body away!

647
01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:02,510

649
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:31,680
SPEAKER_16: You never had the chance to eat
the dumplings I packed for you.

650
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:35,449
SPEAKER_16: Mommy's made you more...

SPEAKER_16: That should be enough.

653
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:46,289

SPEAKER_16: a nice, deep sleep.

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,739
SPEAKER_16: In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,640
SPEAKER_16: So sleep well now.

658
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:08,220
SPEAKER_16: Mommy will come see you every day.

659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,649
SPEAKER_16: Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_16: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_16: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_16: from making you go.

663
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,109
SPEAKER_16: It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_16: If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
SPEAKER_16: I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

666
01:17:51,489 --> 01:17:53,430
SPEAKER_16: Oh, my poor darling.

668
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,989
SPEAKER_16: The one who ran over my son?

669
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:32,529
SPEAKER_16: What's he doing here?

671
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,670
SPEAKER_16: - He's already here.
- Tell him to go.

672
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,609
SPEAKER_16: It's me, Chunsheng.

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_16: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_16: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691

697
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,779
SPEAKER_16: District Chief, let's go.

698

790
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,020
SPEAKER_16: Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?

791
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,760
SPEAKER_16: He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.

794

SPEAKER_16: How's this for Fengxia?

799
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:00,890
SPEAKER_16: Comrade, could I look at that one?

806
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,569
SPEAKER_16: A cripple?

807
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:21,539

808
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,310
SPEAKER_16: He doesn't like Fengxia,
so he tears the place down.

811

SPEAKER_16: We'd better hurry.

828

SPEAKER_16: Fengxia's had a hard life.

838

853
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,479
SPEAKER_16: and she can't even join in!

859
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,250
SPEAKER_16: Let's get the whole family.

860
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:55,979

SPEAKER_16: Go on, don't be sad.

880
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,649
SPEAKER_16: Water's not boiled.

894
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:36,130
SPEAKER_16: Give it back to him.

895
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,630
SPEAKER_16: I don't want his gifts.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_16: But it's Chairman Mao.

900
01:40:19,069 --> 01:40:20,340

SPEAKER_16: You brought a bottle.

917
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,460
SPEAKER_16: Erxi, when you went to the hospital today...

918
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,560
SPEAKER_16: what did they say about Fengxia's health?

920
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,000
SPEAKER_16: Still, you can't be too careful.

921
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,829
SPEAKER_16: Your folks aren't around.

922
01:41:58,909 --> 01:42:02,069
SPEAKER_16: After the birth,
you'll stay with us for a while.

923
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:07,609
SPEAKER_16: Spend as much time as you can with her.

924
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:11,149
SPEAKER_16: When I was pregnant with Fengxia...

925
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,449
SPEAKER_16: her dad was never around.

927
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,680
SPEAKER_16: Very!

937
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,529
SPEAKER_16: After the child is born...

938
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,399
SPEAKER_16: have a photo taken every year.

939
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,369
SPEAKER_16: We've no photos of Fengxia as a child.

940
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:09,569
SPEAKER_16: Okay.

941
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:13,109
SPEAKER_16: Fengxia, after the child is born...

991
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,220
SPEAKER_16: Chunsheng, it's cold.

992
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,399
SPEAKER_16: Come inside.

1000
01:48:14,409 --> 01:48:16,680
SPEAKER_16: Mr. Niu, is your wife at home?

1001
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,810
SPEAKER_16: Yes.

1003
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:25,989
SPEAKER_16: Fengxia's about to have a baby.
It's to thank the matchmaker!

1010
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,779
SPEAKER_16: We'll bring the baby to see you.

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_16: What's happened?

1018
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,939
SPEAKER_16: You! Crimes?

1023
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:33,449
SPEAKER_16: When will they let you return?

1032
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:15,359
SPEAKER_16: When is it due?

1038
01:50:35,659 --> 01:50:37,350
SPEAKER_16: Where's the towel?

1039
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,430
SPEAKER_16: Here, bite on this. It'll save your teeth.

1040
01:50:47,399 --> 01:50:49,829
SPEAKER_16: Do whatever the doctor tells you.

1051
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:29,000
SPEAKER_16: Are they nurses?

1057
01:51:39,489 --> 01:51:41,579
SPEAKER_16: We must find a good doctor.

1066
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,359
SPEAKER_16: Erxi, I'm worried.

1067
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:24,899
SPEAKER_16: Fengxia's a mute.

1068
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,300
SPEAKER_16: Can these young people cope?

1083
01:53:45,479 --> 01:53:47,909
SPEAKER_16: Wang Bin, don't make any trouble.

1084
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:49,510
SPEAKER_16: Don't move.

1095
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,199
SPEAKER_16: Go ask.

1102
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:49,029
SPEAKER_16: They've gone to eat.

1104
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,470
SPEAKER_16: They say she's fine.

1105
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:53,899
SPEAKER_16: Want one?

1106
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,069
SPEAKER_16: Give them to Dr. Wang.

1109
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:24,060
SPEAKER_16: Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?

1111
01:56:27,869 --> 01:56:29,899
SPEAKER_16: Will the baby be crippled?

1116
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,390
SPEAKER_16: What name do you like?

1117
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,729
SPEAKER_16: "Don't Gamble."

1120
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:08,949
SPEAKER_16: "Little Bun."

1123
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,350
SPEAKER_16: But it's a tradition.

1124
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,949
SPEAKER_16: Cat, Dog or Little Bun...

1125
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,020
SPEAKER_16: are not recorded in the Register of Names.

1126
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:24,189
SPEAKER_16: He'd know for sure.

1127
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,789
SPEAKER_16: He doesn't know those kids exist...

1128
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:30,000
SPEAKER_16: so they don't die.

1129
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,829
SPEAKER_16: That's what the old folks say.

1130
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:37,739
SPEAKER_16: Okay, then Little Bun it is.

1131
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:40,109
SPEAKER_16: For now, anyway.

1132
01:57:41,149 --> 01:57:44,409
SPEAKER_16: Later, his dad can give him a proper name.

1136
01:58:13,779 --> 01:58:15,649
SPEAKER_16: We said it would be fine!

1137
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,310
SPEAKER_16: Comrade, how's my daughter?

1138
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,380
SPEAKER_16: Fine. Mother and son are fine.

1139
01:58:20,449 --> 01:58:22,510
SPEAKER_16: Is he normal?

1140
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,680
SPEAKER_16: Absolutely.

1142
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,550
SPEAKER_16: No, there's danger of infection.

1143
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:30,390
SPEAKER_16: Let us have a quick peek, please?

1146
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,260
SPEAKER_16: It's a boy.

1147
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:07,890
SPEAKER_16: They are fine. He's 7.9 pounds.

1153
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:23,270
SPEAKER_16: Wait outside. When we're finished,
you can see her as much as you want.

1164
01:59:53,949 --> 01:59:57,439
SPEAKER_16: Erxi, seeing as they are both fine...

1165
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,850
SPEAKER_16: why don't you see Dr. Wang back.

1170
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:23,630
SPEAKER_16: Quick, get some water.

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,579
SPEAKER_16: Some water should help.

1187
02:01:53,029 --> 02:01:54,930
SPEAKER_16: Get Dr. Wang over here.

1188
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,770
SPEAKER_16: What's wrong with him? What happened?

1194
02:02:15,149 --> 02:02:18,020
SPEAKER_16: It was the water that did it.

1195
02:02:18,619 --> 02:02:20,680
SPEAKER_16: Never mind. Drag him over!

1196
02:02:21,489 --> 02:02:23,720
SPEAKER_16: She's bleeding! Quick!

1197
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:36,270
SPEAKER_16: Please, Doctor, please!

1198
02:02:37,739 --> 02:02:39,539
SPEAKER_16: You'll pull through!

1199
02:02:40,649 --> 02:02:42,199
SPEAKER_16: It's all right.

1200
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,949
SPEAKER_16: Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1201
02:02:52,289 --> 02:02:53,590
SPEAKER_16: Dr. Wang!

1202
02:02:53,989 --> 02:02:56,149
SPEAKER_16: - Feeling better?
- Not at all.

1204
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:11,069
SPEAKER_16: Fengxia! You'll pull through.
Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1205
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,210
SPEAKER_16: Please, Doctor, she's my only daughter.

1207
02:03:26,859 --> 02:03:30,420
SPEAKER_16: Fengxia! Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1208
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:53,039
SPEAKER_16: Some years later...

1217
02:04:56,279 --> 02:04:58,010
SPEAKER_16: Such a good little boy.

1218
02:04:58,079 --> 02:04:59,850
SPEAKER_16: Ten whole thermoses.

1225
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,609
SPEAKER_16: I want to visit Fengxia's grave again...

1226
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:28,310
SPEAKER_16: and take Little Bun's photos...

1227
02:05:28,979 --> 02:05:30,510
SPEAKER_16: to show her.

1228
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,149
SPEAKER_16: He's another year older.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_16: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_16: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1242
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:37,770
SPEAKER_16: - And Fengxia?
- Mommy.

1243
02:06:39,289 --> 02:06:40,979
SPEAKER_16: What a clever boy!

1245
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:48,619
SPEAKER_16: Before you were born...

1246
02:06:49,729 --> 02:06:51,890
SPEAKER_16: Granny said to mommy that...

1247
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:55,069
SPEAKER_16: she should take a photo every year.

1252
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:11,449
SPEAKER_16: He always carries on like this.

1260
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:38,510
SPEAKER_16: Erxi, is it true that Dr. Wang...

1261
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,779
SPEAKER_16: won't eat buns, only rice now?

1265
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,949
SPEAKER_16: What a food bill he must have.

1287
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,829
SPEAKER_16: You will ride on an ox's back.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_16: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...
