207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_00: Youqing, excellent.

242
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,930
SPEAKER_00: I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,190
SPEAKER_00: Earn your money yourself.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_00: And live a good life.

343
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,190
SPEAKER_00: It's your daddy.

344
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,440
SPEAKER_00: What are you doing?

345
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,769
SPEAKER_00: Where's mommy?

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_00: They shot him.

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_00: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_00: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_00: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_00: that'd have been me.

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_00: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_00: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_00: You have to go smelt steel.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_00: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_00: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_00: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_00: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_00: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_00: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_00: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_00: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_00: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_00: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_00: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_00: The sheep will turn into an ox.

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_00: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_00: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_00: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_00: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

680
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,689
SPEAKER_00: I had only one son!

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_00: From where?

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_00: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_00: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_00: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_00: "The working class leads us all."

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
SPEAKER_00: Come on, you can't cry today.

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_00: On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_00: Better when you come over.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_00: No wonder there's a bottle!

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_00: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_00: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_00: Just say what you want.

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_00: You mustn't lose hope.

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_00: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_00: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_00: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to live anymore!

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,659
SPEAKER_00: Yes, come in.

994
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,199
SPEAKER_00: No, thank you, I've got to go.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_00: You, a capitalist?

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_00: Okay, we're going.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_00: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_00: Take your time. There's plenty.

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_00: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_00: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_00: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1172
02:00:40,989 --> 02:00:42,590
SPEAKER_00: Have some water.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_00: Take the medicine to Granny.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_00: Have you had your medicine?

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_00: I'll make lunch.
