20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_01: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_01: How much?

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_01: He's just singing to himself.

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_01: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_01: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_01: Let me wipe your tears.

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
SPEAKER_01: You bet your property.
It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,110
SPEAKER_01: You don't have a roof tile to your name.

122
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,090
SPEAKER_01: What is it?

123
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,620
SPEAKER_01: Master Fugui must settle his account.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_01: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_01: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_01: Just call me Fugui.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_01: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_01: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_01: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_01: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_01: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_01: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_01: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_01: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_01: Which corpses?

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_01: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_01: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_01: we've got to make it back alive.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_01: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_01: The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_01: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_01: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_01: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_01: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_01: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_01: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_01: She can't even say "Daddy."

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_01: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_01: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_01: We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_01: Fugui, you're back just in time...

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_01: Five bullets. Five.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_01: What class do we belong to?

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_01: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_01: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_01: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_01: they captured two mountains a day.

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_01: Don't you understand?

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_01: You're the District Chief?

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_01: Everyone knows about them.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_01: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_01: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_01: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_01: Put these old things to new use.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_01: Don't you see what they are?

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_01: Classic feudal types.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_01: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_01: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_01: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_01: We'll discuss it later.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_01: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_01: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_01: He's also got a handicap...

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_01: Comrade Fengxia.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_01: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_01: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_01: No, really.

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_01: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_01: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_01: We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_01: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_01: Shall we set a date?

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_01: Come on inside.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_01: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_01: Don't be like that.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_01: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_01: But here's boiled water.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_01: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_01: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_01: Can't we put this behind us?

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_01: If only Youqing had been here today.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
SPEAKER_01: I'll be going.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_01: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_01: I was a real no-hoper.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_01: What do you mean?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_01: Killed herself?

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_01: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_01: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_01: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_01: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_01: you've got to bear it!

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_01: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_01: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_01: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_01: Can we see them?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_01: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_01: Careful, it's hot.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_01: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_01: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_01: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_01: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_01: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,329 --> 02:01:16,520
SPEAKER_01: Quick!

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_01: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_01: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_01: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_01: Seven times seven is 49.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_01: Rice costs more than wheat.

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_01: the chickens will turn into geese...

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_01: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_01: and life will get better and better.
