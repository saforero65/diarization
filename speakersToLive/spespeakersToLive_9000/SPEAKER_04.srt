40
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,579
SPEAKER_04: Look at the records.

78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,819

100
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,590
SPEAKER_04: Let's roll!

126
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,950

164
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,269
SPEAKER_04: No, Fugui's signature is on each one.

165

SPEAKER_04: Good.

168
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,829
SPEAKER_04: A gambling debt's a debt,
and debts must be paid.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_04: I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_04: Until you're set up elsewhere.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_04: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

244

SPEAKER_04: Put together a troupe.

245

246
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,250
SPEAKER_04: My heart is full of sorrow

247
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,339
SPEAKER_04: It's that hateful bandit, Jiang

248
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:08,619
SPEAKER_04: I'm lucky to be alive

638
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,130

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_04: Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,930
SPEAKER_04: Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,329
SPEAKER_04: Really?

913
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:28,000
SPEAKER_04: I just came from the hospital.

914
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:32,239
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's going to be a mother.

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,119
SPEAKER_04: He was very busy?

944
01:43:25,989 --> 01:43:28,829
SPEAKER_04: He's been arrested as a capitalist.

945
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,829
SPEAKER_04: They held a public trial against him.

946
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,930
SPEAKER_04: We have to draw a line between us and him.

1062
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,159
SPEAKER_04: Yes, us!

1063
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,399
SPEAKER_04: I mean, older ones.

1071
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,239
SPEAKER_04: Have to get one out.

1086
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,289
SPEAKER_04: That's professor Wang...

1087
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,229
SPEAKER_04: head of obstetrics.

1166
02:00:00,789 --> 02:00:02,380
SPEAKER_04: What's with him?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_04: He ate too quickly.

1262
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:44,180
SPEAKER_04: Not just buns...

1263
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:46,310
SPEAKER_04: anything made from wheat.
