98
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,389
SPEAKER_26: Of course.

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_26: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_26: Get out of my sight!

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_26: This can't be happening!

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_26: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_26: We'll settle everything then.

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_26: It really is booze!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_26: What happened? No one's left?

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_26: This is too much.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_26: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_26: Sit then. Right in front of me!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_26: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

590
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,539
SPEAKER_26: and we'll liberate Taiwan!

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_26: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_26: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_26: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_26: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_26: You've gone to so much trouble.

831
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:14,779
SPEAKER_26: Please come again.

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489
SPEAKER_26: What do you think about Fengxia and me?

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
SPEAKER_26: Time to wrap up.

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_26: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_26: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_26: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_26: Can't you see?

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_26: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_26: Do you hear him?

1149
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,329
SPEAKER_26: Are they in there?

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_26: We'll see them soon.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_26: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_26: Yes, just gobbled them up.
