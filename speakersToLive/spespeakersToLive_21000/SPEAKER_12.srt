281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_12: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_12: No one's looking after them?

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_12: Was it from some dead officer?

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_12: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_12: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,589
SPEAKER_12: They've all run off.

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
SPEAKER_12: How could that be?

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_12: The Reds must be on the attack.

304
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,130
SPEAKER_12: What?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
SPEAKER_12: - Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_12: Run now...

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_12: How?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_12: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_12: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_12: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_12: Just put those hands up.

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_12: The coat's from my brother's unit.
