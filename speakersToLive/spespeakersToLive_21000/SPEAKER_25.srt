54
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,519
SPEAKER_25: I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,360
SPEAKER_25: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_25: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

59
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,939
SPEAKER_25: Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

135
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,950
SPEAKER_25: What are you doing?

138
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,919
SPEAKER_25: - Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

330
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,269
SPEAKER_25: Lao Quan! They're shooting!

335
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,730
SPEAKER_25: What's your brother look like?

336
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,269
SPEAKER_25: Just like me.

337
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,019
SPEAKER_25: Lao Quan!

517
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:23,280
SPEAKER_25: You won't go?

519
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,320
SPEAKER_25: Leave him alone! I'll kill him!

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_25: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_25: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_25: You spoil him.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_25: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_25: Say I want him to.

570
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,329
SPEAKER_25: Good boy, bring it over here.

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_25: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_25: How do you like my singing?

591
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,359
SPEAKER_25: Xia, Youqing, have some dumplings.

641
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,439
SPEAKER_25: What's happened?

642
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,350
SPEAKER_25: Answer me!

643
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,460
SPEAKER_25: Daddy's here! Say something!

645
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:47,569
SPEAKER_25: We mustn't let his mother see.

646
01:14:55,819 --> 01:14:58,220
SPEAKER_25: Mommy's here! Youqing!

680
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,689
SPEAKER_25: I had only one son!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_25: And you killed him!

682
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,000
SPEAKER_25: You, behind the goddamn wheel!

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_25: Do stay! Come on inside.

855
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,229
SPEAKER_25: Time for a photo!

856
01:35:18,869 --> 01:35:20,840
SPEAKER_25: Move aside! Stand still!

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_25: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
SPEAKER_25: He's eaten too much.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_25: What do you mean?
