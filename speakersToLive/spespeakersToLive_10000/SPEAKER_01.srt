20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_01: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_01: How much?

26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_01: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_01: He's just singing to himself.

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_01: Don't cry.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_01: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_01: It's settled.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_01: Youqing, excellent.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_01: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_01: It's crowded with all of us here.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_01: Just call me Fugui.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_01: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_01: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_01: No, his real name's Youqing.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_01: Which corpses?

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_01: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_01: The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_01: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_01: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_01: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_01: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_01: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_01: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_01: She can't even say "Daddy."

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_01: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_01: We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_01: Fugui, you're back just in time...

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_01: Five bullets. Five.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_01: What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_01: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_01: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_01: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_01: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_01: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_01: Better dry it out fast.

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_01: It can't be worth much.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_01: We are less politically aware than your son.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_01: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_01: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_01: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_01: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_01: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_01: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_01: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_01: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_01: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_01: Put these old things to new use.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_01: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_01: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_01: We'll discuss it later.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_01: He can run?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_01: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_01: I approve.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_01: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_01: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_01: "The working class leads us all."

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_01: We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_01: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_01: Shall we set a date?

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_01: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_01: Jiazhen, make some tea.

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_01: Don't go. The tea's ready.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_01: Don't bring up the past.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_01: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_01: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_01: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_01: What do you mean?

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_01: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_01: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_01: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_01: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_01: you've got to bear it!

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_01: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_01: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_01: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_01: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_01: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_01: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_01: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_01: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_01: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_01: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_01: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_01: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_01: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_01: to think of a name for the kid?

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_01: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_01: What name do you like?

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_01: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_01: I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_01: Take the medicine to Granny.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_01: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_01: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_01: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_01: Seven times seven is 49.

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_01: Let's see.
