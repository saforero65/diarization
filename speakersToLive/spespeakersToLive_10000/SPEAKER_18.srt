171
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,500
SPEAKER_18: The Xu family home...

172
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,099
SPEAKER_18: goes to Long'er.

173
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,640
SPEAKER_18: And the debt is hereby settled.

260
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,470
SPEAKER_18: Besides...

261
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,859
SPEAKER_18: troops for both sides are everywhere.

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,410
SPEAKER_18: Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,259
SPEAKER_18: As for me...

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,599
SPEAKER_18: if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,859
SPEAKER_18: Chunsheng, you really are mad.

278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_18: What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_18: What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,549
SPEAKER_18: The wounded.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_18: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_18: No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
SPEAKER_18: No one's left.

284
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,119
SPEAKER_18: Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_18: Was it from some dead officer?

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_18: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_18: Besides, we're from the same town.

306
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,599
SPEAKER_18: Home!

307
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,769
SPEAKER_18: Home?

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
SPEAKER_18: Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_18: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_18: and you'll be shot.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_18: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_18: You want to go home, don't run.

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_18: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_18: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_18: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_18: Just put those hands up.

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
SPEAKER_18: It's all in this account. Take it.
