65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_25: It's not good for the baby.

66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,149
SPEAKER_25: You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

67
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
SPEAKER_25: Who was gambling? I went to watch.

71
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,899
SPEAKER_25: I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

164
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,269
SPEAKER_25: No, Fugui's signature is on each one.

165
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:42,950
SPEAKER_25: Long'er, is our Xu family home...

166
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:46,650
SPEAKER_25: enough to settle Fugui's debt?

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_25: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_25: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_25: Life won't be easy.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_25: Great at any price.

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_25: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_25: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_25: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_25: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_25: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

319
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,940
SPEAKER_25: This will do the trick?

380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_25: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_25: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_25: Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,119
SPEAKER_25: He has served in the Liberation Army?

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_25: You participated in the revolution.

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_25: That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_25: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_25: to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,579
SPEAKER_25: Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,210
SPEAKER_25: What did Long'er do?

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_25: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_25: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_25: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_25: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_25: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_25: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_25: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_25: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,409
SPEAKER_25: It's all here?

451
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,760
SPEAKER_25: Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,619
SPEAKER_25: To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_25: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_25: We'll take these.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
SPEAKER_25: It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_25: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_25: So let's get that metal.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_25: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_25: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_25: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_25: You can leave those.

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_25: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

487
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:58,269
SPEAKER_25: Big ambition for a little kid.

488
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,539
SPEAKER_25: It's more than enough.

489
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,570
SPEAKER_25: So gobble away. Help yourself to sauces.

490
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,010
SPEAKER_25: Youqing, I'll help you stir that up.

491
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:15,820
SPEAKER_25: What a big appetite!

492
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,329
SPEAKER_25: And so much chili sauce!

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_25: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_25: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_25: You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_25: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_25: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

608
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,390
SPEAKER_25: Come on, get up.

609
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,159
SPEAKER_25: Your classmates are already on their way.

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_25: The District Chief has come.

668
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,989
SPEAKER_25: The one who ran over my son?

671
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,670
SPEAKER_25: - He's already here.
- Tell him to go.

674
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,930
SPEAKER_25: after I settled in.

675
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:07,930
SPEAKER_25: Fugui...

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,699
SPEAKER_25: how could it be your son?

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_25: You're the District Chief?

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_25: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_25: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_25: How can I ever make it up?

686
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,489
SPEAKER_25: Take this for now.

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_25: I think you should go, Chief.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_25: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

720
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,140
SPEAKER_25: Sit here.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
SPEAKER_25: You have to get rid of those puppets.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_25: Everyone knows about them.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_25: Don't you see what they are?

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_25: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_25: Classic feudal types.

730
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,119
SPEAKER_25: Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,760
SPEAKER_25: "The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_25: Do as Chairman Mao says.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_25: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_25: Fetch a brazier.

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_25: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_25: to get you a better job. What do you think?

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_25: I've found just the man for her.

748
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:30,909
SPEAKER_25: His name is Wan Erxi.

749
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:34,750
SPEAKER_25: He works in a factory in the county seat.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
SPEAKER_25: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_25: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_25: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_25: He's also got a handicap...

754
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,170
SPEAKER_25: a lame leg.

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_25: Yes, and run if he has to.

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
SPEAKER_25: No, it was an accident at work.

760
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,979
SPEAKER_25: He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_25: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_25: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_25: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

765
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,420
SPEAKER_25: Comrade Wan Erxi.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,989
SPEAKER_25: Fengxia's mom and dad.

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,289
SPEAKER_25: Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_25: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_25: Solid working class stock.

773
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,890
SPEAKER_25: Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
SPEAKER_25: Where's Fengxia?

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_25: Comrade Fengxia.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_25: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_25: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_25: No, really.

811
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:33,079
SPEAKER_25: We'd better hurry.

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_25: Erxi is good with his hands.

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_25: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

828
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:01,909
SPEAKER_25: I'll get some water so you can wash up.

829
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:04,810
SPEAKER_25: Thanks, we'll go to the factory bathhouse.

908
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:50,100
SPEAKER_25: Help me with the table.

916
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:38,680
SPEAKER_25: Cheers!

952
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,210
SPEAKER_25: Chunsheng.

958
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,819
SPEAKER_25: It'll just take a minute.

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_25: All my debts will have been paid.

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_25: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_25: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_25: Have you seen her body?

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_25: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_25: Another working class member on the way!

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_25: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_25: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_25: I have to confess my crimes.

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_25: Everyone knows you.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_25: I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_25: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_25: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_25: Go now, I'll be okay.

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_25: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_25: Let me wear it!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_25: I'll go buy some buns.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_25: Can we see them?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_25: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_25: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_25: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_25: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,579
SPEAKER_25: Some water should help.
