Show them what it takes.

105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,879

Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_19: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

304
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,130
SPEAKER_19: What?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
SPEAKER_19: - Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

959
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:09,489

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
