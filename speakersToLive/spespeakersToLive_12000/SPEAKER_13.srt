134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_13: This can't be happening!

135
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,950
SPEAKER_13: What are you doing?

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_13: Sit down.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_13: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_13: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_13: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_13: I'll look after her for a few days?

231
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,009
SPEAKER_13: I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,519
SPEAKER_13: Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,990
SPEAKER_13: I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_13: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_13: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_13: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_13: Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_13: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_13: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170
SPEAKER_13: Take this.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_13: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

291
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,089
SPEAKER_13: Lao Quan, have a drink.

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_13: It really is booze!

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_13: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_13: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_13: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
SPEAKER_13: I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,969
SPEAKER_13: - Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:17,269
SPEAKER_13: - Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,039
SPEAKER_13: - I'm telling you to go!
- No!

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
SPEAKER_13: Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,909
SPEAKER_13: Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,599
SPEAKER_13: come see the show.

547
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_13: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909
SPEAKER_13: He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:25,420
SPEAKER_13: and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
SPEAKER_13: I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,139
SPEAKER_13: Far away, we flee with haste

552
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,710
SPEAKER_13: Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_13: Hold your little Red Books.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_13: Good idea.
