22
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,659
SPEAKER_11: Chunsheng.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,840
SPEAKER_11: I've run up a pile of debts lately.

380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_11: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_11: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_11: Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,119
SPEAKER_11: He has served in the Liberation Army?

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_11: That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_11: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_11: to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,579
SPEAKER_11: Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,210
SPEAKER_11: What did Long'er do?

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_11: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_11: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_11: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_11: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_11: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_11: It burnt for days.

405
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,429
SPEAKER_11: Of course. You're you, he's him.

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,409
SPEAKER_11: It's all here?

451
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,760
SPEAKER_11: Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,619
SPEAKER_11: To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_11: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_11: We'll take these.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_11: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_11: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_11: When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_11: just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_11: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_11: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_11: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_11: But that's wood.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_11: We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
SPEAKER_11: It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_11: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_11: So let's get that metal.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_11: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_11: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_11: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_11: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

575
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,690
SPEAKER_11: We've smelted our steel...

576
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,989
SPEAKER_11: and reached our production target.

577
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:54,500
SPEAKER_11: We're off to report the good news.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,219
SPEAKER_11: Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_11: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_11: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_11: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_11: and the last in the toilet!

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_11: The District Chief has come.

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_11: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_11: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_11: How can I ever make it up?

718
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,710
SPEAKER_11: - You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_11: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

720
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,140
SPEAKER_11: Sit here.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
SPEAKER_11: You have to get rid of those puppets.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_11: Everyone knows about them.

730
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,119
SPEAKER_11: Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,760
SPEAKER_11: "The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_11: Do as Chairman Mao says.

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_11: Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,930
SPEAKER_11: Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_11: Fetch a brazier.

738
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,609
SPEAKER_11: Fugui...

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_11: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_11: to get you a better job. What do you think?

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_11: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

745
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,390
SPEAKER_11: I'll tell you about him.

746
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,100
SPEAKER_11: Let's not let her in on it for now.

764
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,449
SPEAKER_11: Comrade Wan Erxi's here.

765
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,420
SPEAKER_11: Comrade Wan Erxi.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,989
SPEAKER_11: Fengxia's mom and dad.

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,289
SPEAKER_11: Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_11: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_11: Solid working class stock.

773
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,890
SPEAKER_11: Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
SPEAKER_11: Where's Fengxia?

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_11: Comrade Fengxia.

786
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:36,689
SPEAKER_11: Let's go.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399
SPEAKER_11: Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_11: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_11: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_11: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_11: What are these eggs for?

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_11: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_11: So we've got to get going.

1011
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,899
SPEAKER_11: - But you won't stay?
- No, thanks.

1012
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:00,090
SPEAKER_11: Never mind. Let's go. Don't worry.

1013
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,289
SPEAKER_11: Why's she crying?

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_11: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_11: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_11: I have to confess my crimes.

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_11: Everyone knows you.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_11: I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_11: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_11: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_11: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_11: Go now, I'll be okay.
