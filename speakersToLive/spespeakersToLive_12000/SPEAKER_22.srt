00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_22: Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_22: Want me to help you?

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_22: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_22: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_22: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

SPEAKER_22: They are fabulous.

304
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,130
SPEAKER_22: What?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
SPEAKER_22: - Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

951
01:44:11,369 --> 01:44:12,770
SPEAKER_22: Who's there?
