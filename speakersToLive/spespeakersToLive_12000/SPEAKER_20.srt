20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_20: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_20: How much?

24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_20: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_20: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_20: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_20: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_20: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_20: Let me wipe your tears.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_20: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_20: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_20: It's settled.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_20: Just call me Fugui.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_20: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_20: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_20: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

271
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,269
SPEAKER_20: One, two, three. One, two, three.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_20: Which corpses?

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_20: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_20: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_20: The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_20: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_20: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_20: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_20: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_20: I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_20: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_20: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_20: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_20: How come Fengxia can't talk?

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_20: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_20: We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_20: Fugui, you're back just in time...

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_20: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_20: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_20: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_20: It can't be worth much.

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_20: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

599
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,920
SPEAKER_20: He's not going anywhere.
He hasn't slept in days.

600
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,390
SPEAKER_20: Leave him alone.

601
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,899
SPEAKER_20: - The District Chief is coming.
- So?

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_20: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_20: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_20: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_20: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_20: You have to go smelt steel.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_20: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_20: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_20: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_20: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_20: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_20: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_20: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_20: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_20: Put these old things to new use.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_20: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_20: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_20: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_20: We'll discuss it later.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_20: He can run?

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_20: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_20: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_20: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_20: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_20: Come on inside.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_20: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_20: Don't be like that.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_20: Can't we put this behind us?

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_20: If only Youqing had been here today.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
SPEAKER_20: I'll be going.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_20: But it's Chairman Mao.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_20: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_20: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_20: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_20: And will be better for your child.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_20: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_20: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_20: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_20: You came for this?

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_20: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_20: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_20: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_20: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_20: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_20: You haven't seen any doctors?

1055
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,239
SPEAKER_20: No.

1056
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,310
SPEAKER_20: Go ask where the doctors are.

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_20: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_20: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_20: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_20: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_20: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_20: You just say anything!

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_20: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_20: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_20: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_20: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_20: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_20: I'll make lunch.

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_20: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_20: give me a hand.

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_20: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_20: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_20: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_20: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_20: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_20: He's a professor, after all.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_20: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_20: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_20: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_20: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_20: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_20: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_20: Rice costs more than wheat.

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_20: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_20: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_20: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_20: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_20: and life will get better and better.
