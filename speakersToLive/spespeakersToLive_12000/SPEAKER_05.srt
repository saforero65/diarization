209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_05: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_05: But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
SPEAKER_05: Let's put the past behind us...

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_05: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_05: It's crowded with all of us here.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_05: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_05: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_05: What's that sound?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_05: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_05: You've looked after us.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_05: And live a good life.

346
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,519
SPEAKER_05: I'm home.

347
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,550
SPEAKER_05: Home.

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_05: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_05: He is dead.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_05: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_05: I approve.

872
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,109
SPEAKER_05: Chunsheng.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_05: Jiazhen, make some tea.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_05: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_05: But here's boiled water.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_05: Erxi, drink up.

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_05: You mustn't lose hope.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_05: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_05: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_05: you've got to bear it!

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_05: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_05: He's all right.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_05: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_05: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_05: I'll go buy some buns.

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_05: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_05: Take your time. There's plenty.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_05: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_05: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_05: to think of a name for the kid?

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_05: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_05: What name do you like?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_05: He ate too quickly.

1224
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:18,770
SPEAKER_05: Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_05: Let's see.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_05: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_05: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_05: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_05: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_05: And soon they'll grow up.

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_05: And then...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_05: and the sheep will turn into oxen.
