75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,009
SPEAKER_23: Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,110
SPEAKER_23: It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
SPEAKER_23: Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

80
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,459
SPEAKER_23: Please.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,689
SPEAKER_23: I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,470
SPEAKER_23: Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,700
SPEAKER_23: Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,509
SPEAKER_23: Tell me.

103
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,980
SPEAKER_23: Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,919
SPEAKER_23: Come home.

154
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,360
SPEAKER_23: I've realized...

155
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,340
SPEAKER_23: you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,600
SPEAKER_23: I'm taking Fengxia with me.

192
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,049
SPEAKER_23: Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,450
SPEAKER_23: Jiazhen.

194
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,549
SPEAKER_23: Come look at your son.

195
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,990
SPEAKER_23: He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_23: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_23: What's his name?

198
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,789
SPEAKER_23: "Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,730
SPEAKER_23: He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,329
SPEAKER_23: Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,759
SPEAKER_23: Me.

202
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,509
SPEAKER_23: Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,509
SPEAKER_23: I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
SPEAKER_23: I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,450
SPEAKER_23: Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,619
SPEAKER_23: I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

212
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,009
SPEAKER_23: and live peacefully.

215
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,789
SPEAKER_23: I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

218
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,569
SPEAKER_23: Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,279
SPEAKER_23: but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,140
SPEAKER_23: We'll work something out.

221
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
SPEAKER_23: I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

223
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,579
SPEAKER_23: Don't say that.

224
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,509
SPEAKER_23: All I ask is a quiet life together.

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_23: A rare visitor indeed.

352
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,920
SPEAKER_23: She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,849
SPEAKER_23: kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,570
SPEAKER_23: You should have written.

361
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,659
SPEAKER_23: and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,489
SPEAKER_23: I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,929
SPEAKER_23: Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,519
SPEAKER_23: The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,789
SPEAKER_23: It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,199
SPEAKER_23: They never get...

367
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,869
SPEAKER_23: a good night's sleep.

371
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,449
SPEAKER_23: In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,019
SPEAKER_23: For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,260
SPEAKER_23: No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,849
SPEAKER_23: When the fever came down...

375
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,059
SPEAKER_23: she'd lost her voice.

376
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,460
SPEAKER_23: You're here.

394
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:47,449
SPEAKER_23: Because of the family home,
he's been sentenced a landlord.

404
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,150
SPEAKER_23: Counterrevolutionary timber.

415
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,500
SPEAKER_23: What's wrong?

416
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
SPEAKER_23: Why are your pants wet?

433
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,699
SPEAKER_23: Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,530
SPEAKER_23: Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,800
SPEAKER_23: Of course.

436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,969
SPEAKER_23: Poor townspeople.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_23: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,579
SPEAKER_23: Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,050
SPEAKER_23: I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,719
SPEAKER_23: Good idea!

542
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,780
SPEAKER_23: Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,420
SPEAKER_23: Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

559
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,750
SPEAKER_23: Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,110
SPEAKER_23: Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,409
SPEAKER_23: Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,599
SPEAKER_23: Take him tea full of vinegar.

563
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,869
SPEAKER_23: That will teach him.

592
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,970
SPEAKER_23: Let them sleep. They'll eat later.

602
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,760
SPEAKER_23: A kid still has to sleep.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_23: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_23: Have 20. You should eat more.

650
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:35,449
SPEAKER_23: Mommy's made you more...

651
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:39,449
SPEAKER_23: twenty this time.

652
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,880
SPEAKER_23: That should be enough.

653
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:46,289
SPEAKER_23: Once you've eaten...

654
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,489
SPEAKER_23: you can sleep...

655
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:51,590
SPEAKER_23: a nice, deep sleep.

754
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,170
SPEAKER_23: a lame leg.

755
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,329
SPEAKER_23: How lame? Can he walk?

758
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:00,949
SPEAKER_23: Was he born a cripple?

767
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:46,350
SPEAKER_23: Come inside.

768
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,140
SPEAKER_23: Have something to drink.

769
01:27:03,579 --> 01:27:05,770
SPEAKER_23: Quotations from Chairman Mao

774
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,520
SPEAKER_23: A good family.

775
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,100
SPEAKER_23: The Liberation Army
gave me that certificate.

781
01:28:20,989 --> 01:28:23,220
SPEAKER_23: Have something to eat first. Lunch is ready.

782
01:28:23,289 --> 01:28:24,659
SPEAKER_23: No, thanks.

790
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,020
SPEAKER_23: Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?

791
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,760
SPEAKER_23: He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_23: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_23: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

794
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,250
SPEAKER_23: I think she likes him.

795
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,779
SPEAKER_23: It's different from before. Look.

796
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,460
SPEAKER_23: Go ask Mr. Niu...

797
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:41,300
SPEAKER_23: what the boy thinks.

806
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,569
SPEAKER_23: A cripple?

807
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:21,539
SPEAKER_23: Must be Wan Erxi!

808
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,310
SPEAKER_23: He doesn't like Fengxia,
so he tears the place down.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_23: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_23: Shall we set a date?

837
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,340
SPEAKER_23: Fengxia's had a hard life.

838
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,109
SPEAKER_23: If you don't mind...

839
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,010
SPEAKER_23: let's make the wedding a real occasion.

840
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,920
SPEAKER_23: To make her happy.

852
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:00,319
SPEAKER_23: They're all singing for Fengxia...

880
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,649
SPEAKER_23: Water's not boiled.

894
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:36,130
SPEAKER_23: Give it back to him.

895
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,630
SPEAKER_23: I don't want his gifts.

917
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,460
SPEAKER_23: Erxi, when you went to the hospital today...

918
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,560
SPEAKER_23: what did they say about Fengxia's health?

920
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,000
SPEAKER_23: Still, you can't be too careful.

921
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,829
SPEAKER_23: Your folks aren't around.

922
01:41:58,909 --> 01:42:02,069
SPEAKER_23: After the birth,
you'll stay with us for a while.

923
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:07,609
SPEAKER_23: Spend as much time as you can with her.

924
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:11,149
SPEAKER_23: When I was pregnant with Fengxia...

925
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,449
SPEAKER_23: her dad was never around.

935
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,260
SPEAKER_23: We haven't taken a photo in years.

937
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,529
SPEAKER_23: After the child is born...

938
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,399
SPEAKER_23: have a photo taken every year.

939
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,369
SPEAKER_23: We've no photos of Fengxia as a child.

991
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,220
SPEAKER_23: Chunsheng, it's cold.

992
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,399
SPEAKER_23: Come inside.

1003
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:25,989
SPEAKER_23: Fengxia's about to have a baby.
It's to thank the matchmaker!

1010
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,779
SPEAKER_23: We'll bring the baby to see you.

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_23: What's happened?

1018
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,939
SPEAKER_23: You! Crimes?

1023
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:33,449
SPEAKER_23: When will they let you return?

1050
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:26,840
SPEAKER_23: They're all so young.

1051
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:29,000
SPEAKER_23: Are they nurses?

1057
01:51:39,489 --> 01:51:41,579
SPEAKER_23: We must find a good doctor.

1066
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,359
SPEAKER_23: Erxi, I'm worried.

1067
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:24,899
SPEAKER_23: Fengxia's a mute.

1068
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,300
SPEAKER_23: Can these young people cope?

1095
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,199
SPEAKER_23: Go ask.

1102
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:49,029
SPEAKER_23: They've gone to eat.

1104
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,470
SPEAKER_23: They say she's fine.

1105
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:53,899
SPEAKER_23: Want one?

1106
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,069
SPEAKER_23: Give them to Dr. Wang.

1109
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:24,060
SPEAKER_23: Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?

1111
01:56:27,869 --> 01:56:29,899
SPEAKER_23: Will the baby be crippled?

1116
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,390
SPEAKER_23: What name do you like?

1117
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,729
SPEAKER_23: "Don't Gamble."

1120
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:08,949
SPEAKER_23: "Little Bun."

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_23: That's not a name!

1123
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,350
SPEAKER_23: But it's a tradition.

1124
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,949
SPEAKER_23: Cat, Dog or Little Bun...

1125
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,020
