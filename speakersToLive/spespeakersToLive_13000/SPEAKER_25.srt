28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,340
SPEAKER_25: Why don't you have a go?
Show them what it takes.

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,450
SPEAKER_25: Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,559
SPEAKER_25: What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_25: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

124
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,149
SPEAKER_25: It's all in order, I'll be going.

125
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,379
SPEAKER_25: Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

126
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,950
SPEAKER_25: for leaving you homeless.

131
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,710
SPEAKER_25: Master Fugui, I'm sorry...

132
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,769
SPEAKER_25: but you've nothing left.
What would you wager?

133
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,809
SPEAKER_25: If you're unhappy, talk to Mr. Xie.

145
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,120
SPEAKER_25: Not that we'd accept it as ante.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_25: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_25: We'll settle everything then.

183
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,660
SPEAKER_25: It's valuable. Don't scratch it. Take it slowly.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_25: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_25: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_25: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_25: I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_25: Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_25: Want me to help you?

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_25: A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_25: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

228
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,769
SPEAKER_25: This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,369
SPEAKER_25: Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_25: Great at any price.

231
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,009
SPEAKER_25: I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,519
SPEAKER_25: Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,990
SPEAKER_25: I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_25: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_25: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

242
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,930
SPEAKER_25: I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,190
SPEAKER_25: Earn your money yourself.

244
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,529
SPEAKER_25: Put together a troupe.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_25: Get it out of my sight then.

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_25: It really is booze!

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,119
SPEAKER_25: He was very busy?

1031
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:12,460
SPEAKER_25: They say she's great. No problems.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_25: Good idea.
