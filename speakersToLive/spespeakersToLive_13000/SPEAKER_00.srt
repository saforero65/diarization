20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_00: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_00: How much?

22
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,659
SPEAKER_00: Chunsheng.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,840
SPEAKER_00: I've run up a pile of debts lately.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_00: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_00: Fugui...

74
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,879
SPEAKER_00: I've said all there is to say.

304
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,130
SPEAKER_00: What?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
SPEAKER_00: - Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_00: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_00: we've got to make it back alive.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_00: And live a good life.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_00: Fengxia!

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_00: They shot him.

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_00: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_00: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_00: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_00: that'd have been me.

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_00: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_00: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_00: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_00: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_00: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_00: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_00: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_00: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_00: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_00: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_00: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_00: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_00: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_00: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_00: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_00: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_00: The sheep will turn into an ox.

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_00: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_00: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_00: From where?

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_00: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_00: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_00: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

872
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,109
SPEAKER_00: Chunsheng.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_00: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_00: But here's boiled water.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_00: No wonder there's a bottle!

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_00: Erxi, drink up.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_00: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_00: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_00: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_00: Just say what you want.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_00: You came for this?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_00: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_00: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_00: Have you seen her body?

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_00: You mustn't lose hope.

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_00: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_00: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_00: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_00: I don't want to live anymore!

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,659
SPEAKER_00: Yes, come in.

994
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,199
SPEAKER_00: No, thank you, I've got to go.

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_00: Okay, we're going.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
SPEAKER_00: Where's Erxi?

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_00: How's Fengxia?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_00: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1172
02:00:40,989 --> 02:00:42,590
SPEAKER_00: Have some water.

1206
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,250
SPEAKER_00: The only child I have left.

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_00: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_00: I'll fix it.
