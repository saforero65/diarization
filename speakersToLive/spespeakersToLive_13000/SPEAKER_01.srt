595
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:52,449
SPEAKER_01: The teacher wants us at school
smelting steel.

1044
01:50:56,939 --> 01:50:59,970

Too early for pushing!

1045
01:51:00,409 --> 01:51:03,750
SPEAKER_01: And what's this shouting? Out!

1046
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:06,250
SPEAKER_01: Go wait in the corridor.

1064
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:06,930
SPEAKER_01: They're all reactionaries.
We've overthrown them.

1065
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:10,609
SPEAKER_01: Relax. Your wife's fine. We can handle this.

1083

1152
01:59:15,609 --> 01:59:18,239

1153
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:23,270

you can see her as much as you want.

02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,960
SPEAKER_01: He'll know.

1188
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,770
SPEAKER_01: What's wrong with him? What happened?

1194
02:02:15,149 --> 02:02:18,020
SPEAKER_01: It was the water that did it.

1195
02:02:18,619 --> 02:02:20,680
SPEAKER_01: Never mind. Drag him over!

1196
02:02:21,489 --> 02:02:23,720
SPEAKER_01: She's bleeding! Quick!

1213
02:04:45,739 --> 02:04:47,800
SPEAKER_01: Granny, your medicine.

1214
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:49,770
SPEAKER_01: Back already?

1215
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,569
SPEAKER_01: Has Little Bun been a good boy?

1216
02:04:52,109 --> 02:04:54,579
SPEAKER_01: I delivered 10 thermoses of water.

1223
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:14,859
SPEAKER_01: I light the fire?

1224
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:18,770
SPEAKER_01: Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1238
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:27,729
SPEAKER_01: Youqing eats dumplings.

1239
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:29,800
SPEAKER_01: Fengxia looks at photos.

1240
02:06:30,439 --> 02:06:33,710
SPEAKER_01: Little Bun, do you know who Youqing is?

1244
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,779
SPEAKER_01: Granny, why all the photos for Fengxia?

1269
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:28,789
SPEAKER_01: Grandpa, where'll we put the chicks?

1276
02:09:05,329 --> 02:09:08,060
SPEAKER_01: When will they grow up?

1277
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:09,829
SPEAKER_01: Very soon.

1278
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,630
SPEAKER_01: And then?

1283
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:27,310
SPEAKER_01: And after the oxen?

1286
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,489
