54
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,519
SPEAKER_12: I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,360
SPEAKER_12: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_12: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_12: He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,319
SPEAKER_12: You're up.

63
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,970
SPEAKER_12: What's wrong?

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_12: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_12: It's not good for the baby.

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_12: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_12: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_12: Let me wipe your tears.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
SPEAKER_12: Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_12: Write that down. Another round.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
SPEAKER_12: No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,779
SPEAKER_12: This is the last time, okay? I promise.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_12: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_12: It's settled.

203
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,509
SPEAKER_12: I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
SPEAKER_12: I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_12: Youqing, excellent.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_12: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_12: But I was too ashamed to see you.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_12: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_12: It's crowded with all of us here.

215
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,789
SPEAKER_12: I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_12: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_12: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

218
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,569
SPEAKER_12: Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,279
SPEAKER_12: but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,140
SPEAKER_12: We'll work something out.

221
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
SPEAKER_12: I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_12: Just call me Fugui.

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_12: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_12: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_12: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_12: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_12: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_12: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

271
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,269
SPEAKER_12: One, two, three. One, two, three.

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_12: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_12: Which corpses?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_12: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_12: You've looked after us.

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_12: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_12: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_12: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_12: The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_12: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_12: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_12: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_12: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_12: I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_12: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_12: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_12: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_12: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_12: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_12: She can't even say "Daddy."

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_12: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_12: We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_12: Fugui, you're back just in time...

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_12: He burnt it?

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_12: Five bullets. Five.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_12: What class do we belong to?

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_12: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_12: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_12: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_12: It can't be worth much.

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_12: they captured two mountains a day.

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_12: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_12: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_12: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_12: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_12: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_12: Say I want him to.

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_12: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_12: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_12: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_12: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_12: Wake up.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_12: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_12: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_12: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

718
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,710
SPEAKER_12: - You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_12: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_12: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_12: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_12: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_12: Put these old things to new use.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_12: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_12: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_12: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_12: We'll discuss it later.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_12: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_12: He's also got a handicap...

754
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,170
SPEAKER_12: a lame leg.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_12: He can run?

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_12: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_12: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_12: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_12: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_12: I approve.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_12: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_12: "The working class leads us all."

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_12: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_12: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_12: Jiazhen, make some tea.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_12: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_12: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_12: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_12: Don't be like that.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_12: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_12: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_12: Can't we put this behind us?

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_12: Don't go. The tea's ready.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_12: Better when you come over.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_12: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_12: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_12: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_12: And will be better for your child.

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_12: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_12: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_12: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_12: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_12: you've got to bear it!

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_12: Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_12: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_12: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_12: You, a capitalist?

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_12: Everyone knows you.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_12: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_12: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_12: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_12: You haven't seen any doctors?

1055
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,239
SPEAKER_12: No.

1056
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,310
SPEAKER_12: Go ask where the doctors are.

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_12: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_12: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_12: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_12: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_12: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_12: I'll go buy some buns.

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_12: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_12: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_12: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_12: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_12: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119

SPEAKER_12: Careful, it's hot.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_12: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_12: I'll make lunch.

1221

1259

SPEAKER_12: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_12: Rice costs more than wheat.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_12: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_12: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273

02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_12: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_12: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
