79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,089
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,879
SPEAKER_02: Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_02: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_02: Get out of my sight!

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_02: This can't be happening!

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_02: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_02: You mocking me?

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_02: Sit then. Right in front of me!

720
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:46,140
SPEAKER_02: Sit here.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
SPEAKER_02: You have to get rid of those puppets.

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_02: There's trouble at your home.

801

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_02: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

830

SPEAKER_02: You've gone to so much trouble.

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_02: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_02: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_02: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_02: Can't you see?

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_02: - Sorry for the trouble.

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_02: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_02: Do you hear him?

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_02: We'll see them soon.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_02: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_02: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_02: Take the medicine to Granny.
