171
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,500
SPEAKER_09: The Xu family home...

172
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,099
SPEAKER_09: goes to Long'er.

174
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,450
SPEAKER_09: Both sides must sign.

256
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,769
SPEAKER_09: Might never go home again.

257
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,220
SPEAKER_09: What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,890
SPEAKER_09: Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,130
SPEAKER_09: The Nationalists will shoot you.

260
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,470
SPEAKER_09: Besides...

261
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,859
SPEAKER_09: troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,569
SPEAKER_09: If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
SPEAKER_09: But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,410
SPEAKER_09: Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,259
SPEAKER_09: As for me...

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,599
SPEAKER_09: if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,859
SPEAKER_09: Chunsheng, you really are mad.

278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_09: What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_09: What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,549
SPEAKER_09: The wounded.

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
SPEAKER_09: No one's left.

284
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,119
SPEAKER_09: Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

290
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,420
SPEAKER_09: Put it on. We must survive.

291
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,089
SPEAKER_09: Lao Quan, have a drink.

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_09: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_09: Besides, we're from the same town.

306
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,599
SPEAKER_09: Home!

307
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,769
SPEAKER_09: Home?

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
SPEAKER_09: Wait right here.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_09: The Reds send POWs home.

319
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,940
SPEAKER_09: This will do the trick?

673
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,159
SPEAKER_09: I meant to call...

675
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:07,930
SPEAKER_09: Fugui...

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,699
SPEAKER_09: how could it be your son?

686
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,489
SPEAKER_09: Take this for now.

702
01:20:56,909 --> 01:20:58,539
SPEAKER_09: I owe you a life.

703
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,739
SPEAKER_09: I will remember.

875
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:52,149
SPEAKER_09: But there were so many people,
I didn't come in.

950
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:07,430
SPEAKER_09: Fugui!

951
01:44:11,369 --> 01:44:12,770
SPEAKER_09: Who's there?

952
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,210
SPEAKER_09: Chunsheng.

958
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,819
SPEAKER_09: It'll just take a minute.

959
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:09,489
SPEAKER_09: Well?

960
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,329
SPEAKER_09: Fugui...

961
01:45:12,329 --> 01:45:15,060
SPEAKER_09: I've always felt terrible about Youqing.

962
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,300
SPEAKER_09: I've often tried to give you money.
You'd never accept it.

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
SPEAKER_09: It's all in this account. Take it.

965
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,819
SPEAKER_09: Take this...

966
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,420
SPEAKER_09: and my heart will be at ease.

969
01:45:47,529 --> 01:45:49,869
SPEAKER_09: Yesterday, my wife killed herself.

974
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:02,340
SPEAKER_09: No.

975
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,979
SPEAKER_09: I just got an official notice.

990
01:47:11,619 --> 01:47:13,449
SPEAKER_09: I don't think I can.

995
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:32,039
SPEAKER_09: I snuck out just now...

996
01:47:32,109 --> 01:47:33,899
SPEAKER_09: and better get back.

997
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:44,350
SPEAKER_09: Chunsheng, remember...

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_09: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_09: Let me wear it!
