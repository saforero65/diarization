66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,149
SPEAKER_06: You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

67
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
SPEAKER_06: Who was gambling? I went to watch.

71
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,899
SPEAKER_06: I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,009
SPEAKER_06: Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,110
SPEAKER_06: It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

152
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,620
SPEAKER_06: Fugui...

153
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,960
SPEAKER_06: I just wanted to tell you...

154
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,360
SPEAKER_06: I've realized...

155
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,340
SPEAKER_06: you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,600
SPEAKER_06: I'm taking Fengxia with me.

157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,659
SPEAKER_06: If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
SPEAKER_06: I won't let him be like you.

191
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,549
SPEAKER_06: Granny!

192
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,049
SPEAKER_06: Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,450
SPEAKER_06: Jiazhen.

194
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,549
SPEAKER_06: Come look at your son.

195
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,990
SPEAKER_06: He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_06: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_06: What's his name?

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,619
SPEAKER_06: I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

224
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,509
SPEAKER_06: All I ask is a quiet life together.

374
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,849
SPEAKER_06: When the fever came down...

375
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,059
SPEAKER_06: she'd lost her voice.

376
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,460
SPEAKER_06: You're here.

394
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:47,449
SPEAKER_06: Because of the family home,
he's been sentenced a landlord.

404
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,150
SPEAKER_06: Counterrevolutionary timber.

415
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,500
SPEAKER_06: What's wrong?

416
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
SPEAKER_06: Why are your pants wet?

455
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:06,710
SPEAKER_06: If you take all our pots away,
how will we cook?

537
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,380
SPEAKER_06: What do you know?

538
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,150
SPEAKER_06: Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,869
SPEAKER_06: Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,860
SPEAKER_06: I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840
SPEAKER_06: Have I ever complained?

542
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,780
SPEAKER_06: Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,420
SPEAKER_06: Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

563
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,869
SPEAKER_06: That will teach him.

650
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:35,449
SPEAKER_06: Mommy's made you more...

651
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:39,449
SPEAKER_06: twenty this time.

653
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:46,289
SPEAKER_06: Once you've eaten...

654
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,489
SPEAKER_06: you can sleep...

655
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:51,590
SPEAKER_06: a nice, deep sleep.

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,739
SPEAKER_06: In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,640
SPEAKER_06: So sleep well now.

658
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:08,220
SPEAKER_06: Mommy will come see you every day.

659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,649
SPEAKER_06: Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_06: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_06: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_06: from making you go.

663
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,109
SPEAKER_06: It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_06: If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
SPEAKER_06: I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

668
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,989
SPEAKER_06: The one who ran over my son?

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_06: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_06: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,100
SPEAKER_06: You killed him! Give him back to me!

692
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,970
SPEAKER_06: Go away!

693
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,640
SPEAKER_06: Remember, you owe us a life.

694
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,380
SPEAKER_06: You killed him. Remember that.

695
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,479
SPEAKER_06: You killed him.

774
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,520
SPEAKER_06: A good family.

775
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,100
SPEAKER_06: The Liberation Army
gave me that certificate.

790
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,020
SPEAKER_06: Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?

794
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,250
SPEAKER_06: I think she likes him.

795
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,779
SPEAKER_06: It's different from before. Look.

796
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,460
SPEAKER_06: Go ask Mr. Niu...

797
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:41,300
SPEAKER_06: what the boy thinks.

798
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,369
SPEAKER_06: How's this for Fengxia?

840
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,920
SPEAKER_06: To make her happy.

852
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:00,319
SPEAKER_06: They're all singing for Fengxia...

853
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,479
SPEAKER_06: and she can't even join in!

909
01:40:59,109 --> 01:41:01,510
SPEAKER_06: You brought a bottle.

917
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,460
SPEAKER_06: Erxi, when you went to the hospital today...

918
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,560
SPEAKER_06: what did they say about Fengxia's health?

927
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,680
SPEAKER_06: Very!

935
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,260
SPEAKER_06: We haven't taken a photo in years.

991
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,220
SPEAKER_06: Chunsheng, it's cold.

992
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,399
SPEAKER_06: Come inside.

1023
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:33,449
SPEAKER_06: When will they let you return?

1032
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:15,359
SPEAKER_06: When is it due?

1095
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,199
SPEAKER_06: Go ask.

1104
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,470
SPEAKER_06: They say she's fine.

1105
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:53,899
SPEAKER_06: Want one?

1138
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,380
SPEAKER_06: Fine. Mother and son are fine.

1139
01:58:20,449 --> 01:58:22,510
SPEAKER_06: Is he normal?

1170
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:23,630
SPEAKER_06: Quick, get some water.

1217
02:04:56,279 --> 02:04:58,010
SPEAKER_06: Such a good little boy.

1218
02:04:58,079 --> 02:04:59,850
SPEAKER_06: Ten whole thermoses.

1225
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,609
SPEAKER_06: I want to visit Fengxia's grave again...

1226
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:28,310
SPEAKER_06: and take Little Bun's photos...

1243
02:06:39,289 --> 02:06:40,979
SPEAKER_06: What a clever boy!

1252
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:11,449
SPEAKER_06: He always carries on like this.

1260
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:38,510
SPEAKER_06: Erxi, is it true that Dr. Wang...

1261
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,779
SPEAKER_06: won't eat buns, only rice now?

1265
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,949
SPEAKER_06: What a food bill he must have.

1284
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:30,079
SPEAKER_06: After oxen...

1285
02:09:32,189 --> 02:09:35,319
SPEAKER_06: After oxen, Little Bun will grow up.
