26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_07: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,629
SPEAKER_07: They're too tired. Been at it all night.

53
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,949
SPEAKER_07: Little bastards from big bastards grow.

54
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,519
SPEAKER_07: I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,360
SPEAKER_07: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_07: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

59
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,939
SPEAKER_07: Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_07: He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,319
SPEAKER_07: You're up.

63
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,970
SPEAKER_07: What's wrong?

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
SPEAKER_07: Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,819
SPEAKER_07: Can't rush these things.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,089
SPEAKER_07: Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
SPEAKER_07: No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,779
SPEAKER_07: This is the last time, okay? I promise.

97
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,529
SPEAKER_07: get a rickshaw to take my wife home. I'm...

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_07: What do you mean?

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_07: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_07: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_07: What happened? No one's left?

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_07: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_07: What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_07: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_07: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_07: they captured two mountains a day.

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_07: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_07: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_07: Do you expect me to believe that?

514
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,969
SPEAKER_07: - Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:17,269
SPEAKER_07: - Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,039
SPEAKER_07: - I'm telling you to go!
- No!

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_07: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_07: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_07: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_07: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_07: You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_07: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_07: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_07: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_07: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_07: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_07: Sit then. Right in front of me!

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_07: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_07: Say I want him to.

569
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,360
SPEAKER_07: Youqing, is that tea for me?

570
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,329
SPEAKER_07: Good boy, bring it over here.

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_07: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_07: How do you like my singing?

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_07: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

591
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,359
SPEAKER_07: Xia, Youqing, have some dumplings.

680
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,689
SPEAKER_07: I had only one son!

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_07: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_07: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_07: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_07: Do stay! Come on inside.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_07: Erxi painted this.

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_07: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

855
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,229
SPEAKER_07: Time for a photo!

856
01:35:18,869 --> 01:35:20,840
SPEAKER_07: Move aside! Stand still!

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_07: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_07: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_07: Don't go. The tea's ready.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_07: You, a capitalist?

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_07: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_07: Okay, we're going.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_07: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
SPEAKER_07: Where's Erxi?

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_07: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_07: We'll see them soon.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_07: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_07: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_07: Careful, it's hot.

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_07: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
SPEAKER_07: He's eaten too much.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_07: What do you mean?

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_07: Is it?

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_07: Take the medicine to Granny.
