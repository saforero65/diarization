20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_08: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_08: How much?

24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_08: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_08: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

29
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,080
SPEAKER_08: Business is good, Mr. Xie.

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_08: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_08: It's not good for the baby.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_08: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_08: Fugui...

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_08: My luck's changed.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_08: Write that down. Another round.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_08: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_08: It's settled.

118
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,690
SPEAKER_08: You've lost everything.

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_08: You can't just win and walk away.

130
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,330
SPEAKER_08: The game's not over yet!

146
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,529
SPEAKER_08: We'll formalize the transfer in a few days...

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,289
SPEAKER_08: and explain to your old man.

150
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,929
SPEAKER_08: Okay?

159
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,179
SPEAKER_08: Master Fugui, I'll take you.

202
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,509
SPEAKER_08: Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,509
SPEAKER_08: I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_08: Youqing, excellent.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_08: Just call me Fugui.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_08: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_08: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_08: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_08: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_08: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_08: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_08: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_08: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_08: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

343
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,190
SPEAKER_08: It's your daddy.

344
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,440
SPEAKER_08: What are you doing?

345
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,769
SPEAKER_08: Where's mommy?

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_08: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_08: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_08: I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_08: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_08: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_08: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_08: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_08: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_08: She can't even say "Daddy."

377
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,000
SPEAKER_08: Fugui's back.

378
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:52,429
SPEAKER_08: This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_08: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_08: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_08: They shot him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_08: He is dead.

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_08: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_08: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_08: Better dry it out fast.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_08: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_08: You can leave those.

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_08: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_08: We're off to the next house.

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
SPEAKER_08: Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,909
SPEAKER_08: Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,599
SPEAKER_08: come see the show.

547
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_08: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909
SPEAKER_08: He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:25,420
SPEAKER_08: and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
SPEAKER_08: I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,139
SPEAKER_08: Far away, we flee with haste

552
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,710
SPEAKER_08: Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

589
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,880
SPEAKER_08: He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_08: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_08: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_08: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_08: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_08: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_08: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_08: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_08: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_08: That's good.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_08: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_08: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_08: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_08: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_08: The sheep will turn into an ox.

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_08: You're the District Chief?

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_08: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_08: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_08: And you killed him!

718
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,710
SPEAKER_08: - You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_08: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_08: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_08: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_08: He's also got a handicap...

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_08: You won't stay?

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_08: "The working class leads us all."

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_08: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_08: We're happy if you are.

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_08: Anytime. You decide.

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_08: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_08: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_08: Let's sing a song!

845
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:05,659
SPEAKER_08: Nothing compares
to the Party's benevolence

846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,229
SPEAKER_08: Chairman Mao is dearer
than father and mother

847
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:18,739
SPEAKER_08: There's nothing as good as socialism

848
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,609
SPEAKER_08: No ocean as deep as class feeling

849
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,680
SPEAKER_08: Maoist Thought
is revolution's treasure trove

850
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:34,630
SPEAKER_08: Whoever opposes it, we take as our enemy

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
SPEAKER_08: Come on, you can't cry today.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_08: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_08: Jiazhen, make some tea.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_08: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_08: Don't be like that.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_08: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_08: But here's boiled water.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_08: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_08: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_08: Can't we put this behind us?

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_08: But it's Chairman Mao.

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_08: On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_08: Better when you come over.

908
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:50,100
SPEAKER_08: Help me with the table.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_08: No wonder there's a bottle!

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_08: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_08: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_08: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_08: And will be better for your child.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_08: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_08: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_08: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_08: All my debts will have been paid.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_08: What do you mean?

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_08: You mustn't lose hope.

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_08: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_08: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_08: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_08: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_08: you've got to bear it!

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_08: Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_08: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_08: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_08: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_08: So we've got to get going.

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_08: Everyone knows you.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_08: Go now, I'll be okay.

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_08: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_08: Let me wear it!

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_08: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_08: He's all right.

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_08: How's Fengxia?

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_08: Take your time. There's plenty.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_08: Can we see them?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_08: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
