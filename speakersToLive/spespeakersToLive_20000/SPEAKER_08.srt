143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480

- They're shooting!

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_08: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_08: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849

SPEAKER_08: Let her go!

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_08: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_08: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_08: No!

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_08: You can't keep them. Burn them!

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_08: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_08: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_08: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_08: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_08: He was starving.

1193
