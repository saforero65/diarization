98
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,389
SPEAKER_25: Of course.

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_25: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_25: Get out of my sight!

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_25: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_25: We'll settle everything then.

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_25: This is too much.

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_25: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_25: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_25: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_25: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_25: You've gone to so much trouble.

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
SPEAKER_25: Time to wrap up.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_25: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_25: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_25: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_25: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_25: Can't you see?

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_25: Do you hear him?

1149
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,329
SPEAKER_25: Are they in there?
