257
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,220
SPEAKER_19: What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,890
SPEAKER_19: Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,130
SPEAKER_19: The Nationalists will shoot you.

268
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:43,619

892
01:39:09,939 --> 01:39:12,739
SPEAKER_19: Jiazhen, I know you don't want to see me.

893

You'd never accept it.

965
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,819

966
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,420
