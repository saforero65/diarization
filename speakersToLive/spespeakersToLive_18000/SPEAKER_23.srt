45
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,620
SPEAKER_23: Dad!

46
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,660
SPEAKER_23: Degenerate! Another night gambling!

145
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,120
SPEAKER_23: Not that we'd accept it as ante.

631
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,670
SPEAKER_23: It's Fugui's son?

632
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,649
SPEAKER_23: District Chief arrived after dark.

633
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,079
SPEAKER_23: He backed up,
and his jeep knocked the wall down.

634
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:19,020
SPEAKER_23: Youqing was sleeping on the other side.

635
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,850
SPEAKER_23: When the wall collapsed...

636
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,159
SPEAKER_23: he didn't have a chance.

637
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:26,560
SPEAKER_23: The District Chief was hurt, too.

638
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,130
SPEAKER_23: He hadn't slept for three days.

639
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:58,420
SPEAKER_23: Fugui, listen to me.

640
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:02,430
SPEAKER_23: We have to try and bear it,
even in the worst of times.

819
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:25,270
SPEAKER_23: Fengxia helped us.

820
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,510
SPEAKER_23: You're just in time. We've just finished.

906
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,409
SPEAKER_23: I'll make something.

907
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:40,220
SPEAKER_23: Lunch is all taken care of.

908
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:50,100
SPEAKER_23: Help me with the table.

919
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:53,890
SPEAKER_23: That she's in terrific shape.

1058
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,550
SPEAKER_23: They've been locked away.

1059
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:48,020
SPEAKER_23: The Red Guards are in control!

1071
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,239
SPEAKER_23: Have to get one out.

1072
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,710
SPEAKER_23: Let me think.

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_23: Do you hear him?

1149
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,329
SPEAKER_23: Are they in there?

1150
01:59:11,869 --> 01:59:13,460
SPEAKER_23: - Have a look.
- Not yet!

1151
01:59:13,539 --> 01:59:15,529
SPEAKER_23: Please, I'm the father!

1155
01:59:28,289 --> 01:59:29,720
SPEAKER_23: Is it a boy?

1156
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:32,279
SPEAKER_23: Yes, 7.9 pounds!

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_23: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1267
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:21,010
SPEAKER_23: No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.

1268
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:24,510
SPEAKER_23: Little Bun, behave yourself.
