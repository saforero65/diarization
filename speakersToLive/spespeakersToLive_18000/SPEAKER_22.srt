68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_22: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_22: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_22: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_22: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_22: Which corpses?

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_22: The day...

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_22: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_22: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_22: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_22: We won't see him for a while.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_22: He burnt it?

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_22: It can't be worth much.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_22: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_22: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_22: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_22: Are 15 dumplings enough?

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_22: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_22: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_22: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_22: Put these old things to new use.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_22: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_22: We'll discuss it later.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_22: He can run?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_22: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_22: I approve.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_22: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_22: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_22: But it's Chairman Mao.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_22: And will be better for your child.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_22: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_22: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_22: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_22: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_22: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_22: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_22: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_22: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_22: to think of a name for the kid?

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_22: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_22: That's not a name!

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_22: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_22: give me a hand.

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_22: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_22: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_22: He's a professor, after all.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_22: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_22: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_22: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_22: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_22: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_22: Rice costs more than wheat.
