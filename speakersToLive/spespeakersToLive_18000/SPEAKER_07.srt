112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_07: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_07: Get out of my sight!

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_07: This is too much.

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_07: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_07: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_07: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_07: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489
SPEAKER_07: What do you think about Fengxia and me?

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
SPEAKER_07: Time to wrap up.

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_07: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_07: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_07: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_07: Can't you see?
