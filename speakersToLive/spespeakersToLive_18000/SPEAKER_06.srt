96
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:03,789
SPEAKER_06: Mr. Xie...

380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_06: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_06: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_06: Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,119
SPEAKER_06: He has served in the Liberation Army?

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_06: You participated in the revolution.

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_06: That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_06: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_06: Fugui, you're back just in time...

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_06: to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,579
SPEAKER_06: Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,210
SPEAKER_06: What did Long'er do?

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_06: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_06: The government wanted part of the house.

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_06: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_06: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

405
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,429
SPEAKER_06: Of course. You're you, he's him.

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,409
SPEAKER_06: It's all here?

451
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,760
SPEAKER_06: Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,619
SPEAKER_06: To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_06: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_06: We'll take these.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_06: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_06: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_06: When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_06: just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_06: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_06: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_06: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_06: But that's wood.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_06: We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
SPEAKER_06: It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_06: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_06: So let's get that metal.

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_06: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

483
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,539
SPEAKER_06: Take that!

484
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,659
SPEAKER_06: - Enough?
- No!

485
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,530
SPEAKER_06: Enough?

486
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,690
SPEAKER_06: Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

575
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,690
SPEAKER_06: We've smelted our steel...

576
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,989
SPEAKER_06: and reached our production target.

577
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:54,500
SPEAKER_06: We're off to report the good news.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,219
SPEAKER_06: Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_06: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_06: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,500
SPEAKER_06: We've made enough steel
for three cannon balls.

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_06: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_06: and the last in the toilet!

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_06: The District Chief has come.

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_06: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_06: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_06: How can I ever make it up?

730
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,119
SPEAKER_06: Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,760
SPEAKER_06: "The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_06: Do as Chairman Mao says.

738
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,609
SPEAKER_06: Fugui...

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_06: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_06: to get you a better job. What do you think?

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_06: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

764
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,449
SPEAKER_06: Comrade Wan Erxi's here.

765
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,420
SPEAKER_06: Comrade Wan Erxi.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,989
SPEAKER_06: Fengxia's mom and dad.

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,289
SPEAKER_06: Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_06: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399
SPEAKER_06: Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_06: What are these eggs for?

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_06: What's happened?

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_06: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_06: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_06: I have to confess my crimes.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_06: I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_06: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_06: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_06: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_06: Go now, I'll be okay.

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
SPEAKER_06: Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.

1030
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:08,390
SPEAKER_06: Everything's fine and normal.

1085
01:53:49,579 --> 01:53:51,909
SPEAKER_06: I wouldn't dare.
