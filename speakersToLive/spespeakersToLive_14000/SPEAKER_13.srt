196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_13: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_13: What's his name?

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_13: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_13: But I was too ashamed to see you.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_13: What's that sound?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_13: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_13: You've looked after us.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_13: And live a good life.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_13: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_13: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_13: Have 20. You should eat more.

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,699
SPEAKER_13: how could it be your son?

872
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,109
SPEAKER_13: Chunsheng.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_13: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_13: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_13: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_13: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_13: And soon they'll grow up.

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_13: And then...
