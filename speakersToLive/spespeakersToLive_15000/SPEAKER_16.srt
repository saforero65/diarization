91
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:48,870
SPEAKER_16: Mr. Long'er says
if you're busy he'll take a rain check.

256
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,769
SPEAKER_16: Might never go home again.

257
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,220
SPEAKER_16: What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,890
SPEAKER_16: Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,130

675
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:07,930
SPEAKER_16: Fugui...

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,699
SPEAKER_16: how could it be your son?

687
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,520
SPEAKER_16: It's money.

702
01:20:56,909 --> 01:20:58,539

875
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:52,149
SPEAKER_16: But there were so many people,
I didn't come in.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
SPEAKER_16: I'll be going.

890

SPEAKER_16: I've always felt terrible about Youqing.

962
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,300
SPEAKER_16: I've often tried to give you money.
You'd never accept it.

969
01:45:47,529 --> 01:45:49,869
