24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_02: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_02: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_02: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_02: He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,319
SPEAKER_02: You're up.

63
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,970
SPEAKER_02: What's wrong?

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_02: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_02: It's not good for the baby.

67
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,720
SPEAKER_02: Who was gambling? I went to watch.

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_02: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_02: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_02: Let me wipe your tears.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_02: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_02: Fugui...

74
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,879
SPEAKER_02: I've said all there is to say.

75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,009
SPEAKER_02: Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,110
SPEAKER_02: It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
SPEAKER_02: Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

80
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,459
SPEAKER_02: Please.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,689
SPEAKER_02: I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,470
SPEAKER_02: Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,700
SPEAKER_02: Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,509
SPEAKER_02: Tell me.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_02: My luck's changed.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
SPEAKER_02: No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,779
SPEAKER_02: This is the last time, okay? I promise.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_02: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_02: It's settled.

103
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,980
SPEAKER_02: Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,919
SPEAKER_02: Come home.

118
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,690
SPEAKER_02: You've lost everything.

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_02: What do you mean?

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_02: You can't just win and walk away.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_02: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_02: What's his name?

198
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,789
SPEAKER_02: "Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,730
SPEAKER_02: He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,329
SPEAKER_02: Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,759
SPEAKER_02: Me.

202
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,509
SPEAKER_02: Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,509
SPEAKER_02: I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
SPEAKER_02: I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,450
SPEAKER_02: Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,619
SPEAKER_02: I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_02: Youqing, excellent.

208
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,160
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_02: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_02: But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
SPEAKER_02: Let's put the past behind us...

212
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,009
SPEAKER_02: and live peacefully.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_02: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_02: It's crowded with all of us here.

215
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,789
SPEAKER_02: I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_02: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_02: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

218
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,569
SPEAKER_02: Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,279
SPEAKER_02: but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,140
SPEAKER_02: We'll work something out.

221
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
SPEAKER_02: I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_02: Life won't be easy.

223
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,579
SPEAKER_02: Don't say that.

224
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,509
SPEAKER_02: All I ask is a quiet life together.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_02: Just call me Fugui.

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_02: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_02: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_02: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_02: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_02: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_02: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_02: You've looked after us.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_02: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_02: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_02: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_02: And live a good life.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia!

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_02: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_02: The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_02: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_02: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

352
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,920
SPEAKER_02: She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,849
SPEAKER_02: kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,570
SPEAKER_02: You should have written.

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_02: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_02: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_02: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_02: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

361
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,659
SPEAKER_02: and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,489
SPEAKER_02: I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,929
SPEAKER_02: Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,519
SPEAKER_02: The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,789
SPEAKER_02: It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,199
SPEAKER_02: They never get...

367
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,869
SPEAKER_02: a good night's sleep.

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_02: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_02: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_02: She can't even say "Daddy."

371
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,449
SPEAKER_02: In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,019
SPEAKER_02: For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,260
SPEAKER_02: No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,849
SPEAKER_02: When the fever came down...

375
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,059
SPEAKER_02: she'd lost her voice.

377
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,000
SPEAKER_02: Fugui's back.

378
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:52,429
SPEAKER_02: This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_02: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_02: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_02: Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,119
SPEAKER_02: He has served in the Liberation Army?

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_02: You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_02: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_02: That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_02: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_02: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_02: Fugui, you're back just in time...

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_02: to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,579
SPEAKER_02: Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,210
SPEAKER_02: What did Long'er do?

394
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:47,449
SPEAKER_02: Because of the family home,
he's been sentenced a landlord.

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_02: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_02: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_02: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_02: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_02: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_02: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_02: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_02: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

405
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,429
SPEAKER_02: Of course. You're you, he's him.

415
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,500
SPEAKER_02: What's wrong?

416
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
SPEAKER_02: Why are your pants wet?

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_02: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_02: They shot him.

419
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,510
SPEAKER_02: They shot Long'er?

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_02: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_02: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_02: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_02: that'd have been me.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_02: What class do we belong to?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_02: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_02: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

427
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,730
SPEAKER_02: Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,070
SPEAKER_02: Ordinary townspeople.

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_02: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_02: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_02: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_02: Better dry it out fast.

433
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,699
SPEAKER_02: Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,530
SPEAKER_02: Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,800
SPEAKER_02: Of course.

436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,969
SPEAKER_02: Poor townspeople.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_02: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,579
SPEAKER_02: Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,050
SPEAKER_02: I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,719
SPEAKER_02: Good idea!

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,409
SPEAKER_02: It's all here?

451
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,760
SPEAKER_02: Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,619
SPEAKER_02: To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_02: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_02: We'll take these.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_02: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_02: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_02: When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_02: just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_02: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_02: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_02: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_02: But that's wood.

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_02: It can't be worth much.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_02: We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
SPEAKER_02: It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_02: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_02: So let's get that metal.

471
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:12,570
SPEAKER_02: The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:15,900
SPEAKER_02: You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,510
SPEAKER_02: and after that...

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_02: they captured two mountains a day.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_02: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_02: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_02: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_02: You can leave those.

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_02: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

483
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,539
SPEAKER_02: Take that!

484
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,659
SPEAKER_02: - Enough?
- No!

523
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:49,469
SPEAKER_02: That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,239
SPEAKER_02: I tried to stop you.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_02: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_02: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_02: You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_02: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_02: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_02: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_02: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_02: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610
SPEAKER_02: You, looking after us! After all these years.

537
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,380
SPEAKER_02: What do you know?

542
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,780
SPEAKER_02: Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,420
SPEAKER_02: Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

556
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,199
SPEAKER_02: Youqing, daddy wants you to see the show.

557
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,500
SPEAKER_02: Well?

558
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,300
SPEAKER_02: I'm not going!

559
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,750
SPEAKER_02: Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,110
SPEAKER_02: Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,409
SPEAKER_02: Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,599
SPEAKER_02: Take him tea full of vinegar.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,219
SPEAKER_02: Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_02: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_02: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_02: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_02: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,500
SPEAKER_02: We've made enough steel
for three cannon balls.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_02: They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_02: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_02: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_02: and the last in the toilet!

589
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,880
SPEAKER_02: He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

592
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,970
SPEAKER_02: Let them sleep. They'll eat later.

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_02: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

599
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,920
SPEAKER_02: He's not going anywhere.
He hasn't slept in days.

600
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,390
SPEAKER_02: Leave him alone.

601
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,899
SPEAKER_02: - The District Chief is coming.
- So?

602
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,760
SPEAKER_02: A kid still has to sleep.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_02: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_02: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_02: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_02: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_02: You have to go smelt steel.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_02: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_02: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_02: Have 20. You should eat more.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_02: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_02: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_02: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_02: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_02: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_02: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_02: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_02: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_02: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_02: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_02: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_02: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_02: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_02: The sheep will turn into an ox.

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_02: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_02: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

650
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:35,449
SPEAKER_02: Mommy's made you more...

651
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:39,449
SPEAKER_02: twenty this time.

652
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,880
SPEAKER_02: That should be enough.

653
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:46,289
SPEAKER_02: Once you've eaten...

654
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,489
SPEAKER_02: you can sleep...

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_02: The District Chief has come.

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_02: You're the District Chief?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_02: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_02: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_02: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_02: How can I ever make it up?

686
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,489
SPEAKER_02: Take this for now.

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_02: I think you should go, Chief.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_02: Everyone knows about them.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_02: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_02: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_02: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_02: Put these old things to new use.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_02: Don't you see what they are?

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_02: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_02: Classic feudal types.

730
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,119
SPEAKER_02: Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,760
SPEAKER_02: "The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_02: Do as Chairman Mao says.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_02: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_02: Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,930
SPEAKER_02: Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_02: Fetch a brazier.

738
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,609
SPEAKER_02: Fugui...

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_02: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_02: to get you a better job. What do you think?

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_02: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_02: We'll discuss it later.

745
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,390
SPEAKER_02: I'll tell you about him.

746
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,100
SPEAKER_02: Let's not let her in on it for now.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_02: I've found just the man for her.

749
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:34,750
SPEAKER_02: He works in a factory in the county seat.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
SPEAKER_02: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_02: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_02: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_02: He's also got a handicap...

754
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,170
SPEAKER_02: a lame leg.

755
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,329
SPEAKER_02: How lame? Can he walk?

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_02: Yes, and run if he has to.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_02: He can run?

758
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:00,949
SPEAKER_02: Was he born a cripple?

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
SPEAKER_02: No, it was an accident at work.

760
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,979
SPEAKER_02: He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_02: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_02: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_02: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

765
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,420
SPEAKER_02: Comrade Wan Erxi.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,989
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's mom and dad.

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,289
SPEAKER_02: Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_02: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_02: Solid working class stock.

773
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,890
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.

774
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,520
SPEAKER_02: A good family.

775
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,100
SPEAKER_02: The Liberation Army
gave me that certificate.

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_02: Comrade Fengxia.

781
01:28:20,989 --> 01:28:23,220
SPEAKER_02: Have something to eat first. Lunch is ready.

782
01:28:23,289 --> 01:28:24,659
SPEAKER_02: No, thanks.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_02: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_02: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_02: No, really.

787
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,420
SPEAKER_02: What do you think?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_02: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_02: I approve.

790
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,020
SPEAKER_02: Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?

791
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,760
SPEAKER_02: He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_02: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

794
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,250
SPEAKER_02: I think she likes him.

795
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,779
SPEAKER_02: It's different from before. Look.

805
01:30:16,609 --> 01:30:18,159
SPEAKER_02: You'd better hurry back.

806
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,569
SPEAKER_02: A cripple?

807
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:21,539
SPEAKER_02: Must be Wan Erxi!

808
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,310
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't like Fengxia,
so he tears the place down.

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_02: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_02: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

811
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:33,079
SPEAKER_02: We'd better hurry.

812
01:30:33,149 --> 01:30:35,180
SPEAKER_02: Don't forget your package!

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_02: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_02: "The working class leads us all."

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_02: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

828
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:01,909
SPEAKER_02: I'll get some water so you can wash up.

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_02: We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_02: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_02: Shall we set a date?

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_02: Anytime. You decide.

837
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,340
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's had a hard life.

838
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,109
SPEAKER_02: If you don't mind...

839
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,010
SPEAKER_02: let's make the wedding a real occasion.

840
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,920
SPEAKER_02: To make her happy.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399
SPEAKER_02: Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_02: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_02: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

852
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:00,319
SPEAKER_02: They're all singing for Fengxia...

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_02: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_02: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen, make some tea.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_02: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_02: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

880
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,649
SPEAKER_02: Water's not boiled.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_02: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_02: Don't be like that.

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_02: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_02: But here's boiled water.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_02: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_02: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_02: Can't we put this behind us?

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_02: If only Youqing had been here today.

894
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:36,130
SPEAKER_02: Give it back to him.

895
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,630
SPEAKER_02: I don't want his gifts.

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_02: On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_02: Better when you come over.

908
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:50,100
SPEAKER_02: Help me with the table.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_02: No wonder there's a bottle!

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,329
SPEAKER_02: Really?

913
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:28,000
SPEAKER_02: I just came from the hospital.
The doctor says it's due in autumn.

914
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:32,239
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's going to be a mother.

917
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,460
SPEAKER_02: Erxi, when you went to the hospital today...

918
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,560
SPEAKER_02: what did they say about Fengxia's health?

920
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,000
SPEAKER_02: Still, you can't be too careful.

921
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,829
SPEAKER_02: Your folks aren't around.

922
01:41:58,909 --> 01:42:02,069
SPEAKER_02: After the birth,
you'll stay with us for a while.

923
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:07,609
SPEAKER_02: Spend as much time as you can with her.

924
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:11,149
SPEAKER_02: When I was pregnant with Fengxia...

925
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,449
SPEAKER_02: her dad was never around.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_02: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_02: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_02: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_02: And will be better for your child.

935
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,260
SPEAKER_02: We haven't taken a photo in years.

936
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,920
SPEAKER_02: This is great.

937
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,529
SPEAKER_02: After the child is born...

938
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,399
SPEAKER_02: have a photo taken every year.

939
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,369
SPEAKER_02: We've no photos of Fengxia as a child.

942
01:43:13,649 --> 01:43:16,239
SPEAKER_02: have a photo taken every year.

943
01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:24,050
SPEAKER_02: Dad, I saw Chunsheng yesterday.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_02: Of course.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_02: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_02: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_02: You came for this?

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_02: All my debts will have been paid.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_02: What do you mean?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_02: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_02: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_02: Have you seen her body?

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_02: You mustn't lose hope.

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_02: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_02: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_02: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_02: I don't want to live anymore!

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_02: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_02: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_02: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_02: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_02: you've got to bear it!

991
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,220
SPEAKER_02: Chunsheng, it's cold.

992
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,399
SPEAKER_02: Come inside.

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_02: What are these eggs for?

1003
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:25,989
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's about to have a baby.
It's to thank the matchmaker!

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_02: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_02: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_02: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_02: So we've got to get going.

1010
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,779
SPEAKER_02: We'll bring the baby to see you.

1011
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,899
SPEAKER_02: - But you won't stay?
- No, thanks.

1012
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:00,090
SPEAKER_02: Never mind. Let's go. Don't worry.

1013
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,289
SPEAKER_02: Why's she crying?

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_02: What's happened?

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_02: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_02: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_02: I have to confess my crimes.

1018
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:16,939
SPEAKER_02: You! Crimes?

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_02: You, a capitalist?

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_02: Everyone knows you.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_02: I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_02: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_02: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_02: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_02: Go now, I'll be okay.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_02: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1032
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:15,359
SPEAKER_02: When is it due?

1050
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:26,840
SPEAKER_02: They're all so young.

1051
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:29,000
SPEAKER_02: Are they nurses?

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_02: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_02: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_02: You haven't seen any doctors?

1055
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,239
SPEAKER_02: No.

1056
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,310
SPEAKER_02: Go ask where the doctors are.

1057
01:51:39,489 --> 01:51:41,579
SPEAKER_02: We must find a good doctor.

1066
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,359
SPEAKER_02: Erxi, I'm worried.

1067
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:24,899
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's a mute.

1068
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,300
SPEAKER_02: Can these young people cope?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_02: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_02: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1081
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,909
SPEAKER_02: To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1085
01:53:49,579 --> 01:53:51,909
SPEAKER_02: I wouldn't dare.

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_02: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_02: Let me wear it!

1095
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,199
SPEAKER_02: Go ask.

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_02: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_02: He's all right.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_02: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_02: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_02: I'll go buy some buns.

1102
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:49,029
SPEAKER_02: They've gone to eat.

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_02: How's Fengxia?

1104
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,470
SPEAKER_02: They say she's fine.

1105
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:53,899
SPEAKER_02: Want one?

1106
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,069
SPEAKER_02: Give them to Dr. Wang.

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_02: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_02: Take your time. There's plenty.

1109
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:24,060
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_02: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1111
01:56:27,869 --> 01:56:29,899
SPEAKER_02: Will the baby be crippled?

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_02: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_02: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_02: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_02: to think of a name for the kid?

1116
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,390
SPEAKER_02: What name do you like?

1117
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,729
SPEAKER_02: "Don't Gamble."

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_02: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_02: What name do you like?

1120
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:08,949
SPEAKER_02: "Little Bun."

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_02: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_02: That's not a name!

1123
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,350
SPEAKER_02: But it's a tradition.

1124
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,949
SPEAKER_02: Cat, Dog or Little Bun...

1125
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,020
SPEAKER_02: are not recorded in the Register of Names.

1126
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:24,189
SPEAKER_02: He'd know for sure.

1127
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,789
SPEAKER_02: He doesn't know those kids exist...

1128
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:30,000
SPEAKER_02: so they don't die.

1129
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,829
SPEAKER_02: That's what the old folks say.

1130
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:37,739
SPEAKER_02: Okay, then Little Bun it is.

1131
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:40,109
SPEAKER_02: For now, anyway.

1132
01:57:41,149 --> 01:57:44,409
SPEAKER_02: Later, his dad can give him a proper name.

1138
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,380
SPEAKER_02: Fine. Mother and son are fine.

1139
01:58:20,449 --> 01:58:22,510
SPEAKER_02: Is he normal?

1140
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,680
SPEAKER_02: Absolutely.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_02: Can we see them?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_02: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1164
01:59:53,949 --> 01:59:57,439
SPEAKER_02: Erxi, seeing as they are both fine...

1165
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,850
SPEAKER_02: why don't you see Dr. Wang back.

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_02: Careful, it's hot.

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,579
SPEAKER_02: Some water should help.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_02: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_02: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_02: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_02: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_02: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,329 --> 02:01:16,520
SPEAKER_02: Quick!

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_02: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_02: I'll fix it.

1217
02:04:56,279 --> 02:04:58,010
SPEAKER_02: Such a good little boy.

1218
02:04:58,079 --> 02:04:59,850
SPEAKER_02: Ten whole thermoses.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_02: Have you had your medicine?

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_02: I'll make lunch.

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_02: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_02: give me a hand.

1224
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:18,770
SPEAKER_02: Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1225
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,609
SPEAKER_02: I want to visit Fengxia's grave again...

1226
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:28,310
SPEAKER_02: and take Little Bun's photos...

1227
02:05:28,979 --> 02:05:30,510
SPEAKER_02: to show her.

1228
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,149
SPEAKER_02: He's another year older.

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_02: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_02: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1245
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:48,619
SPEAKER_02: Before you were born...

1246
02:06:49,729 --> 02:06:51,890
SPEAKER_02: Granny said to mommy that...

1247
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:55,069
SPEAKER_02: she should take a photo every year.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_02: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_02: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_02: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_02: He's a professor, after all.

1252
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:11,449
SPEAKER_02: He always carries on like this.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_02: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_02: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_02: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_02: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_02: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_02: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_02: Rice costs more than wheat.

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_02: Let's see.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_02: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_02: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_02: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_02: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_02: And soon they'll grow up.

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_02: And then...

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_02: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_02: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_02: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1287
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,829
SPEAKER_02: You will ride on an ox's back.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_02: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_02: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_02: and life will get better and better.
