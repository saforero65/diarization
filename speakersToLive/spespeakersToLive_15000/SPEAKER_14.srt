278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_14: What a bloodbath.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_14: They're freezing.

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_14: Was it from some dead officer?

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_14: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_14: Besides, we're from the same town.

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_14: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_14: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
SPEAKER_14: How could that be?

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_14: The Reds must be on the attack.

306
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,599
SPEAKER_14: Home!

307
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,769
SPEAKER_14: Home?

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
SPEAKER_14: Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_14: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_14: and you'll be shot.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_14: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_14: You want to go home, don't run.

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_14: How?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_14: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_14: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_14: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_14: Just put those hands up.

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_14: The coat's from my brother's unit.
