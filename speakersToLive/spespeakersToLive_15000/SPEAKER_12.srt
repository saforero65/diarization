105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,879
SPEAKER_12: Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,450
SPEAKER_12: Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,559
SPEAKER_12: What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_12: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

124
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,149
SPEAKER_12: It's all in order, I'll be going.

125
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,379
SPEAKER_12: Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

126
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,950
SPEAKER_12: for leaving you homeless.

127
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,590
SPEAKER_12: But I sure like that mansion of yours.

128
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,230
SPEAKER_12: See you there in a few days.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_12: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_12: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_12: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_12: I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_12: Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_12: Want me to help you?

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_12: A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_12: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

228
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,769
SPEAKER_12: This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,369
SPEAKER_12: Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_12: Great at any price.

231
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,009
SPEAKER_12: I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,519
SPEAKER_12: Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,990
SPEAKER_12: I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_12: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_12: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

242
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,930
SPEAKER_12: I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,190
SPEAKER_12: Earn your money yourself.

244
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,529
SPEAKER_12: Put together a troupe.

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
SPEAKER_12: They are fabulous.

246
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,250
SPEAKER_12: My heart is full of sorrow

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,119
SPEAKER_12: He was very busy?

945
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,829
SPEAKER_12: They held a public trial against him.

946
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,930
SPEAKER_12: We have to draw a line between us and him.

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_12: From the contractions, not right now.

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
SPEAKER_12: Comrade, are there any doctors?

1062
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,159
SPEAKER_12: Yes, us!

1063
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,399
SPEAKER_12: I mean, older ones.

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_12: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.

1170
02:00:21,539 --> 02:00:23,630
SPEAKER_12: Quick, get some water.
