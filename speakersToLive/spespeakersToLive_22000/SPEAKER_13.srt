112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_13: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_13: Get out of my sight!

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_13: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_13: We'll settle everything then.

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_13: It really is booze!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_13: What happened? No one's left?

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,589
SPEAKER_13: They've all run off.

485
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,530
SPEAKER_13: Enough?

486
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,690
SPEAKER_13: Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_13: This is too much.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_13: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_13: Sit then. Right in front of me!

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_13: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_13: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_13: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_13: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_13: You've gone to so much trouble.

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_13: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_13: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_13: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_13: Can't you see?

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_13: We'll see them soon.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_13: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_13: Yes, just gobbled them up.
