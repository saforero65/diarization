260
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,470
SPEAKER_19: Besides...

261
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,859
SPEAKER_19: troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,569
SPEAKER_19: If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
SPEAKER_19: But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,410
SPEAKER_19: Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,259
SPEAKER_19: As for me...

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,599
SPEAKER_19: if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,859
SPEAKER_19: Chunsheng, you really are mad.

278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_19: What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_19: What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,549
SPEAKER_19: The wounded.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_19: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_19: No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
SPEAKER_19: No one's left.

284
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,119
SPEAKER_19: Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

290
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,420
SPEAKER_19: Put it on. We must survive.

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_19: Was it from some dead officer?

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_19: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_19: Besides, we're from the same town.

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_19: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_19: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_19: The Reds must be on the attack.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_19: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_19: and you'll be shot.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_19: The Reds send POWs home.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_19: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_19: You want to go home, don't run.

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_19: How?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_19: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_19: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_19: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_19: Just put those hands up.

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_19: The coat's from my brother's unit.
