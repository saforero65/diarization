813
01:31:06,489 --> 01:31:08,079
SPEAKER_16: Aren't you busy!

814
01:31:08,659 --> 01:31:10,680
SPEAKER_16: I brought some colleagues.

815
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,779
SPEAKER_16: We're fixing the place up.

816
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,960
SPEAKER_16: We replaced the roof tiles...

817
01:31:16,029 --> 01:31:18,159
SPEAKER_16: so it wouldn't leak anymore.

818
01:31:18,529 --> 01:31:21,369
SPEAKER_16: And we've painted Chairman Mao's portrait.

819
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:25,270
SPEAKER_16: Fengxia helped us.

868
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,409
SPEAKER_16: I'm taking Fengxia.

869
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:40,649
SPEAKER_16: I'll look after her.

906
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,409
SPEAKER_16: I'll make something.

907
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:40,220
SPEAKER_16: Lunch is all taken care of.

910
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:17,659
SPEAKER_16: Dad, Mom, we're having a baby.

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,329
SPEAKER_16: Really?

913
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:28,000
SPEAKER_16: I just came from the hospital.
The doctor says it's due in autumn.

919
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:53,890
SPEAKER_16: That she's in terrific shape.

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,119
SPEAKER_16: He was very busy?

934
01:42:41,649 --> 01:42:43,579
SPEAKER_16: I had the photo framed.

944
01:43:25,989 --> 01:43:28,829
SPEAKER_16: He's been arrested as a capitalist.

945
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,829
SPEAKER_16: They held a public trial against him.

946
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,930
SPEAKER_16: We have to draw a line between us and him.

1030
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:08,390
SPEAKER_16: Everything's fine and normal.

1031
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:12,460
SPEAKER_16: They say she's great. No problems.

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_16: From the contractions, not right now.

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
SPEAKER_16: Comrade, are there any doctors?

1062
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,159
SPEAKER_16: Yes, us!

1063
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,399
SPEAKER_16: I mean, older ones.

1071
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,239
SPEAKER_16: Have to get one out.

1072
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,710
SPEAKER_16: Let me think.

1075
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:22,050
SPEAKER_16: This is the same Wang Bin
who once insulted...

1076
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,359
SPEAKER_16: me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1089
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:19,439
SPEAKER_16: I was putting on a show.

1090
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,699
SPEAKER_16: We're not accusing you.

1091
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:23,770
SPEAKER_16: My wife's having a baby.

1092
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,350
SPEAKER_16: I wanted you here for her sake.

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_16: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,760
SPEAKER_16: If you get a car from the factory...

1162
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,399
SPEAKER_16: we can drive Fengxia home.

1171
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:28,539
SPEAKER_16: You two get the car, we'll be fine.

1172
02:00:40,989 --> 02:00:42,590
SPEAKER_16: Have some water.

1231
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,029
SPEAKER_16: We should've bought them
on the way home.

1232
02:05:50,539 --> 02:05:52,659
SPEAKER_16: Now we've got to carry them!

1233
02:05:53,369 --> 02:05:55,399
SPEAKER_16: Careful! Don't drop them!

1266
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,979
SPEAKER_16: - I'll make dinner.
- I'll help.

1267
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:21,010
SPEAKER_16: No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.

1268
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:24,510
SPEAKER_16: Little Bun, behave yourself.
