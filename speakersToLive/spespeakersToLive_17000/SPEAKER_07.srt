260
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,470
SPEAKER_07: Besides...

261
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,859
SPEAKER_07: troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,569
SPEAKER_07: If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
SPEAKER_07: But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,410
SPEAKER_07: Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,259
SPEAKER_07: As for me...

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,599
SPEAKER_07: if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,859
SPEAKER_07: Chunsheng, you really are mad.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_07: What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,549
SPEAKER_07: The wounded.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_07: No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
SPEAKER_07: No one's left.

284
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,119
SPEAKER_07: Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_07: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_07: Besides, we're from the same town.

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_07: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
SPEAKER_07: It's all in this account. Take it.
