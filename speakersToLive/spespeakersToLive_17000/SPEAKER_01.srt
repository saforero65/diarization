125
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,379
SPEAKER_01: Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

126
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,950
SPEAKER_01: for leaving you homeless.

127
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,590
SPEAKER_01: But I sure like that mansion of yours.

132
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,769
SPEAKER_01: but you've nothing left.
What would you wager?

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_01: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_01: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_01: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_01: I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_01: Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_01: Want me to help you?

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_01: A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_01: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_01: Great at any price.

231
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,009
SPEAKER_01: I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,519
SPEAKER_01: Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,990
SPEAKER_01: I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_01: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_01: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

242
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,930
SPEAKER_01: I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,190
SPEAKER_01: Earn your money yourself.

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
SPEAKER_01: They are fabulous.

246
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,250
SPEAKER_01: My heart is full of sorrow

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_01: Good idea.
