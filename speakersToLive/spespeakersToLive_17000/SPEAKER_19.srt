20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_19: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_19: How much?

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_19: He's just singing to himself.

62
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,319
SPEAKER_19: You're up.

63
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,970
SPEAKER_19: What's wrong?

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_19: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_19: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_19: Let me wipe your tears.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_19: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_19: But I was too ashamed to see you.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_19: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_19: It's crowded with all of us here.

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_19: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_19: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_19: Which corpses?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_19: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_19: You've looked after us.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_19: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_19: The day...

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_19: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_19: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_19: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_19: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_19: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_19: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_19: We won't see him for a while.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_19: He burnt it?

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_19: It can't be worth much.

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_19: they captured two mountains a day.

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_19: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_19: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_19: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_19: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_19: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_19: You have to go smelt steel.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_19: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_19: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_19: Have 20. You should eat more.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_19: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_19: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_19: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_19: Put these old things to new use.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_19: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_19: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_19: He can run?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_19: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_19: I approve.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_19: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_19: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_19: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_19: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_19: Don't go. The tea's ready.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_19: And will be better for your child.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_19: Erxi, drink up.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_19: Just say what you want.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_19: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_19: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_19: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_19: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_19: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_19: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_19: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_19: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_19: I'll go buy some buns.

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_19: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_19: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_19: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_19: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_19: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_19: to think of a name for the kid?

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_19: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_19: What name do you like?

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_19: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_19: That's not a name!

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_19: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_19: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_19: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_19: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_19: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_19: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_19: give me a hand.

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_19: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_19: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_19: He's a professor, after all.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_19: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_19: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_19: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_19: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_19: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_19: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_19: Rice costs more than wheat.

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_19: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_19: and life will get better and better.
