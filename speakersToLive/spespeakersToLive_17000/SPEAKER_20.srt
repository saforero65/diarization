278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_20: What a bloodbath.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_20: They're freezing.

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_20: It really is booze!

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_20: Was it from some dead officer?

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_20: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_20: The Reds must be on the attack.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_20: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_20: and you'll be shot.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_20: The Reds send POWs home.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_20: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_20: You want to go home, don't run.

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_20: How?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_20: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_20: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_20: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_20: Just put those hands up.

1206
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,250
SPEAKER_20: The only child I have left.
