24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_18: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_18: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_18: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

61
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,180
SPEAKER_18: He's just singing to himself.

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_18: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_18: It's not good for the baby.

68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_18: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_18: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_18: Let me wipe your tears.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_18: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_18: Fugui...

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_18: My luck's changed.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_18: Write that down. Another round.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570
SPEAKER_18: No, have him wait. I'll be right there.

93
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,779
SPEAKER_18: This is the last time, okay? I promise.

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_18: What do you mean?

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_18: You can't just win and walk away.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_18: Youqing, excellent.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_18: Just call me Fugui.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_18: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_18: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_18: No, his real name's Youqing.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_18: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_18: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_18: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

269
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:46,170
SPEAKER_18: As for me...

270
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,569
SPEAKER_18: I want to live. There's nothing like family.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_18: Which corpses?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_18: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_18: You've looked after us.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_18: They won't shoot us?

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_18: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_18: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_18: we've got to make it back alive.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_18: And live a good life.

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_18: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_18: Fengxia!

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_18: Mother died without knowing where I was.

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_18: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_18: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_18: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_18: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_18: She can't even say "Daddy."

377
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,000
SPEAKER_18: Fugui's back.

378
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:52,429
SPEAKER_18: This is our town leader, Mr. Niu.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_18: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_18: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_18: He burnt it?

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_18: Pumped five bullets into him.

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_18: Landlords?

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_18: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_18: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_18: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_18: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

474
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:21,710
SPEAKER_18: they captured two mountains a day.

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_18: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_18: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

525
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,539
SPEAKER_18: Why wouldn't he just apologize?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_18: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_18: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_18: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_18: How do you like my singing?

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_18: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_18: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_18: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_18: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_18: You have to go smelt steel.

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_18: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_18: Our family...

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_18: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_18: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_18: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_18: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

718
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,710
SPEAKER_18: - You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_18: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_18: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_18: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_18: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_18: Put these old things to new use.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_18: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_18: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_18: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_18: I approve.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_18: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_18: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_18: From where?

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_18: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_18: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_18: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_18: "The working class leads us all."

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_18: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_18: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_18: Jiazhen, make some tea.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_18: Isn't the tea ready yet?

879
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,840
SPEAKER_18: Chunsheng's been here for ages.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_18: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_18: Don't be like that.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_18: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_18: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_18: Can't we put this behind us?

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_18: Don't go. The tea's ready.

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_18: On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_18: Better when you come over.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_18: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_18: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_18: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_18: And will be better for your child.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_18: Of course.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_18: Just say what you want.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_18: You came for this?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_18: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_18: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_18: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_18: Have you seen her body?

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_18: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_18: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_18: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_18: Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_18: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_18: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_18: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_18: So we've got to get going.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_18: You, a capitalist?

1020
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,939
SPEAKER_18: Everyone knows you.

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_18: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1047
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:08,010
SPEAKER_18: Okay, we're going.

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_18: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_18: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_18: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_18: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_18: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_18: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_18: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_18: How's Fengxia?

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_18: Take your time. There's plenty.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_18: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_18: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_18: That's not a name!

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_18: Careful, it's hot.

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_18: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_18: I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_18: Take the medicine to Granny.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_18: Have you had your medicine?

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_18: I'll make lunch.

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_18: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_18: give me a hand.

1224
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:18,770
SPEAKER_18: Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_18: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_18: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_18: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_18: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_18: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_18: He's a professor, after all.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_18: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_18: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_18: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_18: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_18: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_18: It's much too much.

1260
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:38,510
SPEAKER_18: Erxi, is it true that Dr. Wang...

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_18: Rice costs more than wheat.

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_18: And then...

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_18: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_18: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_18: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_18: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_18: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_18: and life will get better and better.
