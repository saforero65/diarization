380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_04: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_04: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_04: Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,119
SPEAKER_04: He has served in the Liberation Army?

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_04: You participated in the revolution.

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_04: That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_04: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_04: Fugui, you're back just in time...

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_04: to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,579
SPEAKER_04: Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,210
SPEAKER_04: What did Long'er do?

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_04: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_04: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_04: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_04: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_04: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_04: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_04: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_04: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

405
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,429
SPEAKER_04: Of course. You're you, he's him.

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,409
SPEAKER_04: It's all here?

451
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,760
SPEAKER_04: Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,619
SPEAKER_04: To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_04: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_04: We'll take these.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_04: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_04: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_04: When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_04: just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_04: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_04: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_04: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_04: But that's wood.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_04: We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
SPEAKER_04: It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_04: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_04: So let's get that metal.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_04: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_04: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_04: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_04: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

483
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,539
SPEAKER_04: Take that!

484
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:47,659
SPEAKER_04: - Enough?
- No!

485
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,530
SPEAKER_04: Enough?

486
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,690
SPEAKER_04: Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,500
SPEAKER_04: We've made enough steel
for three cannon balls.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_04: They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_04: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_04: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_04: and the last in the toilet!

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_04: The District Chief has come.

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_04: I think you should go, Chief.

721
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,460
SPEAKER_04: You have to get rid of those puppets.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_04: Everyone knows about them.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_04: Don't you see what they are?

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_04: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_04: Classic feudal types.

730
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,119
SPEAKER_04: Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,760
SPEAKER_04: "The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_04: Do as Chairman Mao says.

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_04: Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,930
SPEAKER_04: Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_04: Fetch a brazier.

738
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,609
SPEAKER_04: Fugui...

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_04: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_04: to get you a better job. What do you think?

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_04: We'll discuss it later.

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_04: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

745
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,390
SPEAKER_04: I'll tell you about him.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_04: I've found just the man for her.

748
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:30,909
SPEAKER_04: His name is Wan Erxi.

749
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:34,750
SPEAKER_04: He works in a factory in the county seat.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
SPEAKER_04: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_04: Yes, and run if he has to.

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
SPEAKER_04: No, it was an accident at work.

760
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,979
SPEAKER_04: He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_04: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_04: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

764
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,449
SPEAKER_04: Comrade Wan Erxi's here.

765
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,420
SPEAKER_04: Comrade Wan Erxi.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,989
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's mom and dad.

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,289
SPEAKER_04: Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_04: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_04: Solid working class stock.

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
SPEAKER_04: Where's Fengxia?

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_04: Comrade Fengxia.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_04: You won't stay?

786
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:36,689
SPEAKER_04: Let's go.

787
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,420
SPEAKER_04: What do you think?

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_04: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_04: What are these eggs for?

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_04: What's happened?

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_04: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_04: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_04: I have to confess my crimes.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_04: I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_04: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_04: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_04: You go to Fengxia.

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
SPEAKER_04: Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.
