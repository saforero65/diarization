814
01:31:08,659 --> 01:31:10,680
SPEAKER_12: I brought some colleagues.

815
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,779
SPEAKER_12: We're fixing the place up.

816
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,960
SPEAKER_12: We replaced the roof tiles...

817
01:31:16,029 --> 01:31:18,159
SPEAKER_12: so it wouldn't leak anymore.

818
01:31:18,529 --> 01:31:21,369
SPEAKER_12: And we've painted Chairman Mao's portrait.

819
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:25,270
SPEAKER_12: Fengxia helped us.

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_12: Anytime. You decide.

868
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,409
SPEAKER_12: I'm taking Fengxia.

869
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:40,649
SPEAKER_12: I'll look after her.

910
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:17,659
SPEAKER_12: Dad, Mom, we're having a baby.

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,329
SPEAKER_12: Really?

913
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:28,000
SPEAKER_12: I just came from the hospital.
The doctor says it's due in autumn.

916
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:38,680
SPEAKER_12: Cheers!

919
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:53,890
SPEAKER_12: That she's in terrific shape.

926
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,119
SPEAKER_12: He was very busy?

944
01:43:25,989 --> 01:43:28,829
SPEAKER_12: He's been arrested as a capitalist.

945
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,829
SPEAKER_12: They held a public trial against him.

946
01:43:32,069 --> 01:43:34,930
SPEAKER_12: We have to draw a line between us and him.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_12: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_12: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

1030
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:08,390
SPEAKER_12: Everything's fine and normal.

1031
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:12,460
SPEAKER_12: They say she's great. No problems.

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_12: From the contractions, not right now.

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
SPEAKER_12: Comrade, are there any doctors?

1062
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,159
SPEAKER_12: Yes, us!

1063
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,399
SPEAKER_12: I mean, older ones.

1071
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,239
SPEAKER_12: Have to get one out.

1072
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,710
SPEAKER_12: Let me think.

1076
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,359
SPEAKER_12: me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1086
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,289
SPEAKER_12: That's professor Wang...

1087
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,229
SPEAKER_12: head of obstetrics.

1088
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,029
SPEAKER_12: Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.

1089
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:19,439
SPEAKER_12: I was putting on a show.

1090
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,699
SPEAKER_12: We're not accusing you.

1091
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:23,770
SPEAKER_12: My wife's having a baby.

1092
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,350
SPEAKER_12: I wanted you here for her sake.

1162
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,399
SPEAKER_12: we can drive Fengxia home.

1171
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:28,539
SPEAKER_12: You two get the car, we'll be fine.

1172
02:00:40,989 --> 02:00:42,590
SPEAKER_12: Have some water.

1231
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,029
SPEAKER_12: We should've bought them
on the way home.

1232
02:05:50,539 --> 02:05:52,659
SPEAKER_12: Now we've got to carry them!

1253
02:07:11,979 --> 02:07:13,350
SPEAKER_12: It's okay.

1262
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:44,180
SPEAKER_12: Not just buns...

1263
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:46,310
SPEAKER_12: anything made from wheat.

1266
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,979
SPEAKER_12: - I'll make dinner.
- I'll help.

1267
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:21,010
SPEAKER_12: No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.

1268
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:24,510
SPEAKER_12: Little Bun, behave yourself.
