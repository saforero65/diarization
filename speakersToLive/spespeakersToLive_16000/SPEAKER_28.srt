78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,819
SPEAKER_28: Can't rush these things.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,089
SPEAKER_28: Fengxia's growing up. Another's on the way.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_28: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_28: It's settled.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_28: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_28: What's his name?

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_28: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_28: But I was too ashamed to see you.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_28: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_28: It's crowded with all of us here.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_28: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_28: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_28: Life won't be easy.

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_28: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_28: They shot him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_28: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_28: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_28: that'd have been me.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_28: What class do we belong to?

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_28: Youqing has to go.

608
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,390
SPEAKER_28: Come on, get up.

609
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,159
SPEAKER_28: Your classmates are already on their way.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_28: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_28: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_28: Have 20. You should eat more.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_28: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_28: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_28: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_28: He's also got a handicap...

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_28: He can run?

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_28: We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_28: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_28: Shall we set a date?

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_28: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_28: But here's boiled water.

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_28: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_28: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_28: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_28: I don't want to live anymore!

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_28: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_28: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_28: you've got to bear it!

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_28: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_28: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_28: I'll go buy some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_28: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_28: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_28: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_28: to think of a name for the kid?

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_28: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_28: What name do you like?

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_28: Can we see them?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_28: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_28: He ate too quickly.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_28: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_28: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_28: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_28: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_28: And soon they'll grow up.
