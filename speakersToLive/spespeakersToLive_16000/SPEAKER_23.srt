28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,340
SPEAKER_23: Why don't you have a go?
Show them what it takes.

105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,879
SPEAKER_23: Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,450
SPEAKER_23: Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,559
SPEAKER_23: What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_23: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

124
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,149
SPEAKER_23: It's all in order, I'll be going.

125
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,379
SPEAKER_23: Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

126
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,950
SPEAKER_23: for leaving you homeless.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_23: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_23: Don't break anything!

187
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,549
SPEAKER_23: I'll look after her for a few days?

188
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,920
SPEAKER_23: Until you're set up elsewhere.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_23: Want me to help you?

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_23: A rare visitor indeed.

226
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,099
SPEAKER_23: Master Fugui! It's been a year at least.

228
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,769
SPEAKER_23: This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,369
SPEAKER_23: Warm in winter, cool in summer.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_23: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_23: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

243
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,190
SPEAKER_23: Earn your money yourself.

244
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,529
SPEAKER_23: Put together a troupe.

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
SPEAKER_23: They are fabulous.

246
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,250
SPEAKER_23: My heart is full of sorrow

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_23: - Already?
- We didn't hear a sound.
