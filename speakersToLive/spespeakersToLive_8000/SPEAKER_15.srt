68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_15: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_15: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_15: Let me wipe your tears.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_15: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_15: It's settled.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_15: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_15: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_15: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_15: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_15: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_15: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_15: We won't see him for a while.

390
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,739
SPEAKER_15: Fugui, you're back just in time...

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_15: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_15: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_15: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_15: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_15: They shot him.

424
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,219
SPEAKER_15: What class do we belong to?

429
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:54,730
SPEAKER_15: Sounds okay to me.
And I took part in the revolution.

430
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,019
SPEAKER_15: - What are you looking for?
- That certificate.

431
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,119
SPEAKER_15: - In the wash?
- No, here it is.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_15: Better dry it out fast.

433
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,699
SPEAKER_15: Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,530
SPEAKER_15: Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_15: You're the District Chief?

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_15: Everyone knows about them.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_15: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_15: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_15: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_15: Put these old things to new use.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_15: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_15: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_15: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_15: I approve.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_15: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_15: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_15: Can't we put this behind us?

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_15: If only Youqing had been here today.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
SPEAKER_15: I'll be going.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_15: What do you mean?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_15: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_15: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_15: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_15: Have you seen her body?

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_15: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_15: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_15: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_15: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_15: you've got to bear it!

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_15: No doctors?

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_15: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_15: Take your time. There's plenty.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_15: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_15: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_15: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_15: What name do you like?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_15: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1173
02:00:44,659 --> 02:00:46,359
SPEAKER_15: Careful, it's hot.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_15: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_15: Seven times seven is 49.
