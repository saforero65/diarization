102
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,740
SPEAKER_18: Come, give Mrs. Xu a seat.

109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330
SPEAKER_18: Get out!

110
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,870
SPEAKER_18: I've just...

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_18: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_18: Get out of my sight!

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_18: This can't be happening!

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_18: Sit down.

138
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,919
SPEAKER_18: - Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_18: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

140
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,769
SPEAKER_18: I am very sorry, but you've got nothing left.

141
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,779
SPEAKER_18: What could you stake the bet on?
We don't accept empty bets.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_18: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

145
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,120
SPEAKER_18: Not that we'd accept it as ante.

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,289
SPEAKER_18: and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_18: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_18: We'll settle everything then.

174
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,450
SPEAKER_18: Both sides must sign.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_18: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_18: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_18: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

228
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,769
SPEAKER_18: This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,369
SPEAKER_18: Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_18: Great at any price.

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_18: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170
SPEAKER_18: Take this.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_18: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

289
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,220
SPEAKER_18: The wounded who froze to death.

290
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,420
SPEAKER_18: Put it on. We must survive.

330
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,269
SPEAKER_18: Lao Quan! They're shooting!

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_18: We won't touch them.

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_18: How could you?

500
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,320
SPEAKER_18: Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_18: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_18: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_18: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_18: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_18: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_18: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_18: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_18: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
SPEAKER_18: I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,969
SPEAKER_18: - Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:17,269
SPEAKER_18: - Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,039
SPEAKER_18: - I'm telling you to go!
- No!

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_18: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_18: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_18: You spoil him.

594
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:49,439
SPEAKER_18: What's up?

631
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,670
SPEAKER_18: It's Fugui's son?

632
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,649
SPEAKER_18: District Chief arrived after dark.

633
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,079
SPEAKER_18: He backed up,
and his jeep knocked the wall down.

634
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:19,020
SPEAKER_18: Youqing was sleeping on the other side.

635
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,850
SPEAKER_18: When the wall collapsed...

636
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,159
SPEAKER_18: he didn't have a chance.

637
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:26,560
SPEAKER_18: The District Chief was hurt, too.

638
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,130
SPEAKER_18: He hadn't slept for three days.

639
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:58,420
SPEAKER_18: Fugui, listen to me.

641
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,439
SPEAKER_18: What's happened?

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_18: Don't be like that.

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_18: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_18: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_18: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_18: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_18: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_18: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_18: Let her go!

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_18: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_18: No!

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_18: You can't keep them. Burn them!

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,869
SPEAKER_18: Comrade Wan Erxi.

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_18: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_18: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_18: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_18: Erxi painted this.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_18: You've gone to so much trouble.

831
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:14,779
SPEAKER_18: Please come again.

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489
SPEAKER_18: What do you think about Fengxia and me?

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_18: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_18: Hold your little Red Books.

858
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,180
SPEAKER_18: Clear a path! Ship sailing through!

863
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:17,989
SPEAKER_18: Chairman Mao...

864
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:21,600
SPEAKER_18: Comrade Fengxia's mine now.

897
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,279
SPEAKER_18: Dad! Mom!

1043
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:56,640
SPEAKER_18: Everything will be fine.

1077
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,359
SPEAKER_18: How vile can you get?

1078
01:53:31,029 --> 01:53:33,159
SPEAKER_18: We dragged him here today...

1079
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,270
SPEAKER_18: to educate him, to criticize him...

1080
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,899
SPEAKER_18: and to let him witness her giving birth.

1081
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,909
SPEAKER_18: To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_18: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1149
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,329
SPEAKER_18: Are they in there?

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_18: We'll see them soon.

1155
01:59:28,289 --> 01:59:29,720
SPEAKER_18: Is it a boy?

1156
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:32,279
SPEAKER_18: Yes, 7.9 pounds!

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_18: Good idea.

1166
02:00:00,789 --> 02:00:02,380
SPEAKER_18: What's with him?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_18: He ate too quickly.

1181
02:01:34,449 --> 02:01:36,810
SPEAKER_18: Don't panic. Think of something.

1182
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:40,979
SPEAKER_18: We're just students.
We don't know what to do.

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_18: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
SPEAKER_18: He's eaten too much.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_18: What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_18: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_18: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_18: But he was okay after the water.
