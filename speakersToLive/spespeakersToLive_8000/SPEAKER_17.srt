SPEAKER_17: Mr. Long'er says
if you're busy he'll take a rain check.

92
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,570

00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,220
SPEAKER_17: What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,890
SPEAKER_17: Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,130
SPEAKER_17: The Nationalists will shoot you.

268
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:43,619

319
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,940

676
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,699
SPEAKER_17: how could it be your son?

687
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,520
SPEAKER_17: It's money.

688
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:07,520
SPEAKER_17: Tell me what else I can do.

702
01:20:56,909 --> 01:20:58,539
SPEAKER_17: I owe you a life.

703
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,739

- A while ago.

875
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:52,149
SPEAKER_17: But there were so many people,
I didn't come in.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_17: Of course.

952

SPEAKER_17: Fugui...

962
01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,300
SPEAKER_17: I've often tried to give you money.
You'd never accept it.

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
SPEAKER_17: It's all in this account. Take it.

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_17: You came for this?

965
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,819

01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,979
SPEAKER_17: I just got an official notice.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_17: Can't you see?

990
01:47:11,619 --> 01:47:13,449
SPEAKER_17: I don't think I can.

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,659
