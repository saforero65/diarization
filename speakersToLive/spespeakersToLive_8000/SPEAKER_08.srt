20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_08: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_08: How much?

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_08: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_08: Fugui...

90
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,250
SPEAKER_08: Well?

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_08: Just call me Fugui.

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_08: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

240
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,710
SPEAKER_08: I'm not one to lend money.

241
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,150
SPEAKER_08: I'll lend you something else. More practical.

242
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:13,930
SPEAKER_08: I never had to beg
when I ran the puppet troupe.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_08: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_08: The day...

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_08: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_08: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_08: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_08: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
SPEAKER_08: Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,909
SPEAKER_08: Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,599
SPEAKER_08: come see the show.

547
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_08: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909
SPEAKER_08: He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:25,420
SPEAKER_08: and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
SPEAKER_08: I yell there's no time to waste

551
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,139
SPEAKER_08: Far away, we flee with haste

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_08: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_08: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_08: Have 20. You should eat more.

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_08: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_08: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_08: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_08: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_08: Don't be like that.

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_08: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_08: I was a real no-hoper.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_08: Erxi, drink up.

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_08: You mustn't lose hope.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_08: Who examined Fengxia?

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_08: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_08: I'll make lunch.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_08: Rice costs more than wheat.
