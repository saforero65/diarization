SPEAKER_12: We'll visit you after
she's out of the hospital.

1036
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:29,010
SPEAKER_12: Remember to breathe and push.

1037
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:34,420
SPEAKER_12: When you're pushing, bite on a towel.

1040
01:50:47,399 --> 01:50:49,829
SPEAKER_12: Do whatever the doctor tells you.

1041
01:50:50,039 --> 01:50:52,130
SPEAKER_12: It'll be quick if you push.

1044
01:50:56,939 --> 01:50:59,970
SPEAKER_12: What's this about pushing?
Too early for pushing!

1045
01:51:00,409 --> 01:51:03,750
SPEAKER_12: And what's this shouting? Out!

No reactionaries allowed!

1075
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:22,050
SPEAKER_12: This is the same Wang Bin

SPEAKER_12: me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1082

SPEAKER_12: It's a boy, 7.9 pounds.

1135
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:13,710
SPEAKER_12: - Already?

1142
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,550
SPEAKER_12: No, there's danger of infection.

1150
01:59:11,869 --> 01:59:13,460
SPEAKER_12: - Have a look.

1152
01:59:15,609 --> 01:59:18,239
SPEAKER_12: It doesn't matter. We're not done yet.

1153
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:23,270
SPEAKER_12: Wait outside. When we're finished,
you can see her as much as you want.

1185
02:01:49,130 --> 02:01:50,689
SPEAKER_12: He'd know for sure.

1186
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,960
SPEAKER_12: He'll know.

1204
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:11,069
SPEAKER_12: Fengxia! You'll pull through.
Mommy's here. Don't be afraid.

1209
02:04:30,189 --> 02:04:32,680
SPEAKER_12: Grandpa! It's crooked again.

1214
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:49,770
SPEAKER_12: Back already?

1215
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,569
SPEAKER_12: Has Little Bun been a good boy?

1216
02:04:52,109 --> 02:04:54,579
SPEAKER_12: I delivered 10 thermoses of water.

1223
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:14,859
SPEAKER_12: I light the fire?

1224
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:18,770
SPEAKER_12: Yes, and I'll make some noodles.

1235
02:05:59,909 --> 02:06:02,470
SPEAKER_12: Grandpa, where will the chicks live?

1241
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:35,039
SPEAKER_12: Uncle.

1269
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:28,789
SPEAKER_12: Grandpa, where'll we put the chicks?

1276
02:09:05,329 --> 02:09:08,060
SPEAKER_12: When will they grow up?

1277
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:09,829
SPEAKER_12: Very soon.

1278
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,630
SPEAKER_12: And then?
