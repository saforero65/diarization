281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_16: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_16: No one's looking after them?

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_16: Was it from some dead officer?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_16: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_16: You've looked after us.

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_16: The Reds must be on the attack.

304
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,130
SPEAKER_16: What?

305
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,340
SPEAKER_16: - Shouldn't we run, too?
- Where to?

306
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,599
SPEAKER_16: Home!

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_16: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_16: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_16: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_16: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_16: She can't even say "Daddy."

380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_16: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_16: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_16: Look at this.

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_16: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_16: to get you a better job. What do you think?
