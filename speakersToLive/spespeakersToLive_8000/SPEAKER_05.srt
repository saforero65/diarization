29
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,080
SPEAKER_05: Business is good, Mr. Xie.

53
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,949
SPEAKER_05: Little bastards from big bastards grow.

62
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,319
SPEAKER_05: You're up.

63
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,970
SPEAKER_05: What's wrong?

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_05: You can't just win and walk away.

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_05: Youqing, excellent.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_05: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_05: You mocking me?

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_05: No, his real name's Youqing.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_05: Which corpses?

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_05: And live a good life.

337
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,019
SPEAKER_05: Lao Quan!

346
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,519
SPEAKER_05: I'm home.

347
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,550
SPEAKER_05: Home.

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_05: How come Fengxia can't talk?

384
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,050
SPEAKER_05: You participated in the revolution.

385
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,449
SPEAKER_05: I just dragged a cannon and sang opera.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_05: He burnt it?

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_05: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_05: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_05: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_05: that'd have been me.

426
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,829
SPEAKER_05: Surely not. We lost that status to Long'er.
So, what are we?

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_05: It can't be worth much.

591
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,359
SPEAKER_05: Xia, Youqing, have some dumplings.

592
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,970
SPEAKER_05: Let them sleep. They'll eat later.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_05: You have to go smelt steel.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_05: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_05: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_05: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_05: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_05: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_05: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_05: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_05: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_05: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_05: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_05: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_05: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_05: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_05: The sheep will turn into an ox.

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_05: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_05: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_05: From where?

809
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:27,039
SPEAKER_05: Anything is possible.

810
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,409
SPEAKER_05: Mr. Niu said he was a Red Guard.

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_05: Erxi is good with his hands.

890
01:39:03,869 --> 01:39:05,829
SPEAKER_05: Don't go. The tea's ready.

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_05: On the mend.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_05: Better when you come over.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_05: But things are better now.

931
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:31,340
SPEAKER_05: And will be better for your child.

936
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,920
SPEAKER_05: This is great.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_05: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_05: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_05: Just say what you want.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_05: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1019
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,670
SPEAKER_05: You, a capitalist?

1027
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:55,340
SPEAKER_05: Niu, don't let it get to you. Take care!

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_05: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_05: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1210
02:04:33,590 --> 02:04:34,789
SPEAKER_05: Is it?

1211
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:36,289
SPEAKER_05: I'll fix it.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_05: Take the medicine to Granny.

1219
02:05:04,359 --> 02:05:06,449
SPEAKER_05: Have you had your medicine?

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_05: give me a hand.

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_05: Are you happy?

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_05: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_05: I'll find a home for them when we get back.
