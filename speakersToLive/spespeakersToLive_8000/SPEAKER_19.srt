SPEAKER_19: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_19: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,149
SPEAKER_19: You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

67

SPEAKER_19: Of course.

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_19: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_19: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_19: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_19: What happened? No one's left?

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_19: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_19: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_19: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_19: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

478

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_19: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_19: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_19: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_19: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

531
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,090
SPEAKER_19: Don't you understand?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_19: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_19: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_19: Sit then. Right in front of me!

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_19: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_19: Say I want him to.

556
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,199
SPEAKER_19: Youqing, daddy wants you to see the show.

569
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,360
SPEAKER_19: Youqing, is that tea for me?

570
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,329
SPEAKER_19: Good boy, bring it over here.

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_19: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_19: - Don't rush off!

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_19: Do stay! Come on inside.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_19: "The working class leads us all."

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_19: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

851

SPEAKER_19: Come on, you can't cry today.

854
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,420
SPEAKER_19: At least it's loud enough for her to hear.

878
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:12,579
SPEAKER_19: Isn't the tea ready yet?
