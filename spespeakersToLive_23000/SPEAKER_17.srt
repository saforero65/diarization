68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_17: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_17: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

207
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,690
SPEAKER_17: Youqing, excellent.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_17: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_17: But I was too ashamed to see you.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_17: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_17: It's crowded with all of us here.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_17: Life won't be easy.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_17: Which corpses?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_17: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_17: You've looked after us.

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_17: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_17: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_17: we've got to make it back alive.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_17: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_17: The day...

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_17: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_17: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_17: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_17: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_17: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_17: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_17: We won't see him for a while.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_17: He burnt it?

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_17: It can't be worth much.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_17: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_17: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_17: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_17: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_17: You have to go smelt steel.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_17: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_17: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_17: Have 20. You should eat more.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_17: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_17: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_17: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_17: Put these old things to new use.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_17: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_17: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_17: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_17: We'll discuss it later.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_17: He can run?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_17: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_17: I approve.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_17: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_17: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_17: Erxi, drink up.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_17: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_17: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_17: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_17: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_17: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_17: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_17: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_17: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_17: I'll go buy some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_17: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_17: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_17: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_17: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_17: to think of a name for the kid?

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_17: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_17: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_17: That's not a name!

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_17: give me a hand.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_17: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_17: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_17: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_17: He's a professor, after all.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_17: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_17: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_17: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_17: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_17: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_17: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_17: Rice costs more than wheat.

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_17: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_17: and life will get better and better.
