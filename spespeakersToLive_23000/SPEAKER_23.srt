42
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,459
SPEAKER_23: Take care.

43
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,319
SPEAKER_23: Take care, Master.

44
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,350
SPEAKER_23: Welcome home, sir.

45
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,620
SPEAKER_23: Dad!

46
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,660
SPEAKER_23: Degenerate! Another night gambling!

133
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,809
SPEAKER_23: If you're unhappy, talk to Mr. Xie.

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_23: This can't be happening!

145
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,120
SPEAKER_23: Not that we'd accept it as ante.

183
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,660
SPEAKER_23: It's valuable. Don't scratch it. Take it slowly.

631
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,670
SPEAKER_23: It's Fugui's son?

632
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,649
SPEAKER_23: District Chief arrived after dark.

633
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,079
SPEAKER_23: He backed up,
and his jeep knocked the wall down.

634
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:19,020
SPEAKER_23: Youqing was sleeping on the other side.

635
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,850
SPEAKER_23: When the wall collapsed...

636
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,159
SPEAKER_23: he didn't have a chance.

637
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:26,560
SPEAKER_23: The District Chief was hurt, too.

638
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,130
SPEAKER_23: He hadn't slept for three days.

639
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:58,420
SPEAKER_23: Fugui, listen to me.

640
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:02,430
SPEAKER_23: We have to try and bear it,
even in the worst of times.

831
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:14,779
SPEAKER_23: Please come again.

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489
SPEAKER_23: What do you think about Fengxia and me?

1058
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,550
SPEAKER_23: They've been locked away.

1059
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:48,020
SPEAKER_23: The Red Guards are in control!

1150
01:59:11,869 --> 01:59:13,460
SPEAKER_23: - Have a look.
- Not yet!

1151
01:59:13,539 --> 01:59:15,529
SPEAKER_23: Please, I'm the father!

1155
01:59:28,289 --> 01:59:29,720
SPEAKER_23: Is it a boy?

1156
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:32,279
SPEAKER_23: Yes, 7.9 pounds!

1157
01:59:32,659 --> 01:59:35,289
SPEAKER_23: - How is he?
- They're both fine!
