00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330
SPEAKER_14: Get out!

110
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,870
SPEAKER_14: I've just...

111
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,240
SPEAKER_14: Let's play!

114
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,850
SPEAKER_14: Go!

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,720
SPEAKER_14: Let's roll!

136
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,110
SPEAKER_14: It's not over yet!

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_14: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_14: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_14: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_14: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_14: Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_14: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_14: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_14: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170
SPEAKER_14: Take this.

334
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,360
SPEAKER_14: - What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_14: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_14: We're off to the next house.

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_14: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_14: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_14: What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_14: What is this?

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_14: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_14: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_14: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_14: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_14: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_14: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_14: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_14: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_14: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_14: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
SPEAKER_14: I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,969
SPEAKER_14: - Are you going?

515
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:17,269

- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,039
SPEAKER_14: - I'm telling you to go!
- No!

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_14: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
SPEAKER_14: Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

699
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:44,560
SPEAKER_14: Go away!

700
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,439

701
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,340
SPEAKER_14: I'm going.

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_14: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_14: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_14: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_14: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_14: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_14: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_14: No!

714
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:07,439
SPEAKER_14: The 1960s

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_14: You can't keep them. Burn them!

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,869
SPEAKER_14: Comrade Wan Erxi.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_14: Erxi painted this.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_14: You've gone to so much trouble.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_14: Let's sing a song!

845
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:05,659
SPEAKER_14: Nothing compares
to the Party's benevolence

846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,229
SPEAKER_14: Chairman Mao is dearer
than father and mother

847
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:18,739
SPEAKER_14: There's nothing as good as socialism

848
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,609
SPEAKER_14: No ocean as deep as class feeling

849
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,680
SPEAKER_14: Maoist Thought
is revolution's treasure trove

850
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:34,630
SPEAKER_14: Whoever opposes it, we take as our enemy

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
SPEAKER_14: Come on, you can't cry today.

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_14: Hold your little Red Books.

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
SPEAKER_14: Time to wrap up.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_14: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

897
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,279
SPEAKER_14: Dad! Mom!

1077
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,359
SPEAKER_14: How vile can you get?

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_14: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_14: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_14: Good idea.

1181
02:01:34,449 --> 02:01:36,810
SPEAKER_14: Don't panic. Think of something.

1182
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:40,979
SPEAKER_14: We're just students.
We don't know what to do.

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_14: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_14: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_14: But he was okay after the water.

1203
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:58,659
SPEAKER_14: Oxygen.
