279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_27: What's that sound?

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_27: The day...

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_27: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_27: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_27: I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_27: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_27: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_27: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
SPEAKER_27: Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,909
SPEAKER_27: Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,599
SPEAKER_27: come see the show.

547
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_27: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_27: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_27: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_27: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_27: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_27: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_27: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_27: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_27: If Youqing does as daddy says...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_27: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_27: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_27: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_27: The sheep will turn into an ox.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_27: But it's Chairman Mao.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_27: Erxi, drink up.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
