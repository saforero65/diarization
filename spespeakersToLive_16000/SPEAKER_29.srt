157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,659
SPEAKER_29: If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
SPEAKER_29: I won't let him be like you.

195

SPEAKER_29: Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,860
SPEAKER_29: I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840

659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,649
SPEAKER_29: Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_29: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_29: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_29: from making you go.

663
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,109
SPEAKER_29: It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_29: If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
SPEAKER_29: I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

669
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:32,529
SPEAKER_29: What's he doing here?

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_29: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_29: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,100
SPEAKER_29: You killed him! Give him back to me!

692
