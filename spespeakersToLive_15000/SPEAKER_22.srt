00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,360
SPEAKER_22: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_22: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

59
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,939
SPEAKER_22: Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130

SPEAKER_22: What's your brother look like?

336
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,269
SPEAKER_22: Just like me.

337
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,019
SPEAKER_22: Lao Quan!

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_22: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_22: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_22: Say I want him to.

570
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,329
SPEAKER_22: Good boy, bring it over here.

591
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,359

680
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,689
SPEAKER_22: I had only one son!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_22: And you killed him!

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_22: Do stay! Come on inside.

855
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,229
SPEAKER_22: Time for a photo!

856
01:35:18,869 --> 01:35:20,840
SPEAKER_22: Move aside! Stand still!
