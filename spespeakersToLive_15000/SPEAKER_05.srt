109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330
SPEAKER_05: Get out!

110
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,870
SPEAKER_05: I've just...

114
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,850
SPEAKER_05: Go!

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,720
SPEAKER_05: Let's roll!

136
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,110
SPEAKER_05: It's not over yet!

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_05: Sit down.

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_05: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
SPEAKER_05: I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480
SPEAKER_05: Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_05: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_05: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_05: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_05: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_05: Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_05: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_05: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170
SPEAKER_05: Take this.

334
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,360
SPEAKER_05: - What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

379
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,400
SPEAKER_05: So you're our leading cadre.

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_05: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_05: We're off to the next house.

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_05: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_05: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_05: What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_05: What is this?

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_05: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_05: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_05: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_05: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_05: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_05: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_05: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_05: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_05: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_05: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_05: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
SPEAKER_05: I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,969
SPEAKER_05: - Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:17,269
SPEAKER_05: - Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,039
SPEAKER_05: - I'm telling you to go!
- No!

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_05: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_05: How do you like my singing?

699
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:44,560
SPEAKER_05: Go away!

700
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,439
SPEAKER_05: All right.

701
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,340
SPEAKER_05: I'm going.

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_05: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_05: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_05: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_05: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_05: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_05: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_05: Let her go!

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_05: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_05: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_05: No!

714
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:07,439
SPEAKER_05: The 1960s

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_05: You can't keep them. Burn them!

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,869
SPEAKER_05: Comrade Wan Erxi.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_05: Erxi painted this.

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_05: Erxi is good with his hands.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_05: Let's sing a song!

845
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:05,659
SPEAKER_05: Nothing compares
to the Party's benevolence

846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,229
SPEAKER_05: Chairman Mao is dearer
than father and mother

847
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:18,739
SPEAKER_05: There's nothing as good as socialism

848
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,609
SPEAKER_05: No ocean as deep as class feeling

849
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,680
SPEAKER_05: Maoist Thought
is revolution's treasure trove

850
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:34,630
SPEAKER_05: Whoever opposes it, we take as our enemy

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
SPEAKER_05: Come on, you can't cry today.

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_05: Hold your little Red Books.

858
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,180
SPEAKER_05: Clear a path! Ship sailing through!

859
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:40,250
SPEAKER_05: Let's get the whole family.

860
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:55,979
SPEAKER_05: The ship of revolution! Advance
through the storm with Chairman Mao!

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_05: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

957
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:32,960
SPEAKER_05: Just say what you want.

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
SPEAKER_05: Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.

1077
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,359
SPEAKER_05: How vile can you get?

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_05: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_05: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_05: Good idea.

1183
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:47,090
SPEAKER_05: Wouldn't Dr. Wang know?

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_05: What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_05: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_05: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_05: But he was okay after the water.
