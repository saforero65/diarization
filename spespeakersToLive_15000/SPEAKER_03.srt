111
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,240
SPEAKER_03: Let's play!

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_03: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_03: Get out of my sight!

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_03: This can't be happening!

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,289
SPEAKER_03: and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_03: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_03: We'll settle everything then.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_03: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_03: It really is booze!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_03: What happened? No one's left?

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_03: This is too much.

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_03: I hit him for not obeying.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_03: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_03: Sit then. Right in front of me!

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_03: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_03: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_03: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_03: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_03: From where?

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_03: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

916
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:38,680
SPEAKER_03: Cheers!

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_03: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_03: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_03: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_03: Can't you see?

1048
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:11,859
SPEAKER_03: - Sorry for the trouble.
- It's our job.

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_03: Do you hear him?

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_03: We'll see them soon.

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_03: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_03: Yes, just gobbled them up.

1212
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:39,260
SPEAKER_03: Take the medicine to Granny.
