140
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,769
SPEAKER_06: I am very sorry, but you've got nothing left.

141
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,779
SPEAKER_06: What could you stake the bet on?
We don't accept empty bets.

SPEAKER_06: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909
SPEAKER_06: He uses the secret mirror

549
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:25,420
SPEAKER_06: and blinds all who look within

550
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:45,210
SPEAKER_06: I yell there's no time to waste

551

1042
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:54,829
SPEAKER_06: Do as Mommy says and push.

1043
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:56,640
SPEAKER_06: Everything will be fine.

1075
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:22,050
SPEAKER_06: This is the same Wang Bin
who once insulted...

1078
01:53:31,029 --> 01:53:33,159
SPEAKER_06: We dragged him here today...

1079
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,270
SPEAKER_06: to educate him, to criticize him...

1080
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,899
SPEAKER_06: and to let him witness her giving birth.

1086
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,289

SPEAKER_06: Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.

1090
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,699
SPEAKER_06: We're not accusing you.

1091
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:23,770
SPEAKER_06: My wife's having a baby.

1092
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,350
SPEAKER_06: I wanted you here for her sake.

1155
01:59:28,289 --> 01:59:29,720

SPEAKER_06: we can drive Fengxia home.

1166

SPEAKER_06: What's with him?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
