66
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,149
SPEAKER_23: You said you wouldn't gamble
if I got pregnant.

71
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,899
SPEAKER_23: I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

152

SPEAKER_23: Fugui...

153
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,960
SPEAKER_23: I just wanted to tell you...

155
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,340
SPEAKER_23: you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,600
SPEAKER_23: I'm taking Fengxia with me.

194
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,549
SPEAKER_23: Come look at your son.

195
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,990

376
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,460
SPEAKER_23: You're here.

404
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,150
SPEAKER_23: Counterrevolutionary timber.

455
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:06,710
SPEAKER_23: If you take all our pots away,
how will we cook?

493
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,900
SPEAKER_23: That's a big bowl, Youqing.

494
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:32,409
SPEAKER_23: Give it to us if you can't finish.

495
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:07,630
SPEAKER_23: What the hell are you doing?

538
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,150
SPEAKER_23: Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,869
SPEAKER_23: Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,860
SPEAKER_23: I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840
SPEAKER_23: Have I ever complained?

649
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:31,680
SPEAKER_23: You never had the chance to eat
the dumplings I packed for you.

655
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:51,590
SPEAKER_23: a nice, deep sleep.

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,739
SPEAKER_23: In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,640
SPEAKER_23: So sleep well now.

658
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:08,220
SPEAKER_23: Mommy will come see you every day.

659
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,649
SPEAKER_23: Youqing, can you ever forgive me?

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_23: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_23: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_23: from making you go.

663
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,109
SPEAKER_23: It's all my fault.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_23: If only I'd stopped him.

665
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:48,720
SPEAKER_23: I shouldn't have let you go, Youqing!

668
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,989
SPEAKER_23: The one who ran over my son?

669
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:32,529
SPEAKER_23: What's he doing here?

670
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,859
SPEAKER_23: Tell him to leave. He killed my son.

671
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,670
SPEAKER_23: - He's already here.
- Tell him to go.

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_23: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_23: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,100
SPEAKER_23: You killed him! Give him back to me!

692
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,970
SPEAKER_23: Go away!

693
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,640
SPEAKER_23: Remember, you owe us a life.

694
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,380
SPEAKER_23: You killed him. Remember that.

695
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,479
SPEAKER_23: You killed him.

696
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,319
SPEAKER_23: Go away! Now!

697
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,779
SPEAKER_23: District Chief, let's go.

796
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,460
SPEAKER_23: Go ask Mr. Niu...

797
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:41,300
SPEAKER_23: what the boy thinks.

798
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:56,369
SPEAKER_23: How's this for Fengxia?

853
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,479
SPEAKER_23: and she can't even join in!

905
01:40:33,989 --> 01:40:35,510
SPEAKER_23: Have you eaten?

909
01:40:59,109 --> 01:41:01,510
SPEAKER_23: You brought a bottle.

927
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,680
SPEAKER_23: Very!

1023
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:33,449
SPEAKER_23: When will they let you return?

1028
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:59,180
SPEAKER_23: We'll visit you after
she's out of the hospital.

1143
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:30,390
SPEAKER_23: Let us have a quick peek, please?

1146
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,260
SPEAKER_23: It's a boy.

1147
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:07,890
SPEAKER_23: They are fine. He's 7.9 pounds.

1243
02:06:39,289 --> 02:06:40,979
SPEAKER_23: What a clever boy!

1260
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:38,510
SPEAKER_23: Erxi, is it true that Dr. Wang...

1261
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,779
SPEAKER_23: won't eat buns, only rice now?

1265
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,949
SPEAKER_23: What a food bill he must have.
