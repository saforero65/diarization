260
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,470
SPEAKER_07: Besides...

261
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,859
SPEAKER_07: troops for both sides are everywhere.

262
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,569
SPEAKER_07: If you don't fight the Reds,
you fight the KMT.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
SPEAKER_07: But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

264
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,410
SPEAKER_07: Forget it. Try to save your own skin.

265
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,259
SPEAKER_07: As for me...

266
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,599
SPEAKER_07: if I weren't looking for my brother,
I wouldn't be wearing this uniform.

267
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,859
SPEAKER_07: Chunsheng, you really are mad.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_07: What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,549
SPEAKER_07: The wounded.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_07: No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
SPEAKER_07: No one's left.

284
00:32:16,089 --> 00:32:19,119
SPEAKER_07: Must be tens of thousands
of us trapped here.

290
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,420
SPEAKER_07: Put it on. We must survive.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_07: The Reds send POWs home.

688
01:20:04,859 --> 01:20:07,520
SPEAKER_07: Tell me what else I can do.

952
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,210
SPEAKER_07: Chunsheng.

953
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:16,640
SPEAKER_07: Who?

958
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,819
SPEAKER_07: It'll just take a minute.

959
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:09,489
SPEAKER_07: Well?

960
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,329
SPEAKER_07: Fugui...

963
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:26,310
SPEAKER_07: It's all in this account. Take it.

965
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:34,819
SPEAKER_07: Take this...

966
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:38,420
SPEAKER_07: and my heart will be at ease.
