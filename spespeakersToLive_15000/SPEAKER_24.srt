18
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:55,730
SPEAKER_24: You've lost again.

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,000
SPEAKER_24: Not one lucky toss all night.

36
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:11,100
SPEAKER_24: Long'er, you're nearly there.

37
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,800
SPEAKER_24: One more night like this...

38
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:19,209
SPEAKER_24: you'll have him right where you want him.

39
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,100
SPEAKER_24: Sure there's no mistake?

40
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,579
SPEAKER_24: Look at the records.

85
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,759
SPEAKER_24: Your win, Master Fugui.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_24: Write that down. Another round.

88
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,080
SPEAKER_24: Master Fugui, your wife's here.

89
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,059
SPEAKER_24: What are you doing here?

90
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,250
SPEAKER_24: Well?

99
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,909
SPEAKER_24: Master Fugui, you lost.

100
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,590
SPEAKER_24: Let's roll!

101
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,990
SPEAKER_24: Master Fugui.

116
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,649
SPEAKER_24: Well?

117
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,360
SPEAKER_24: Master Fugui, you're out of the game.

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
SPEAKER_24: You bet your property.
It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,110
SPEAKER_24: You don't have a roof tile to your name.

122
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,090
SPEAKER_24: What is it?

123
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,620
SPEAKER_24: Master Fugui must settle his account.

150
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,929
SPEAKER_24: Okay?

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_24: Written?

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_24: He burnt it?

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_24: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

776
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,909
SPEAKER_24: Good.

872
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,109
SPEAKER_24: Chunsheng.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_24: But it's Chairman Mao.

897
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,279
SPEAKER_24: Dad! Mom!

898
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,470
SPEAKER_24: Come on in!

910
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:17,659
SPEAKER_24: Dad, Mom, we're having a baby.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_24: Erxi, drink up.

940
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:09,569
SPEAKER_24: Okay.

941
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:13,109
SPEAKER_24: Fengxia, after the child is born...

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_24: Time does fly!

1089
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:19,439
SPEAKER_24: I was putting on a show.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_24: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_24: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1267
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:21,010
SPEAKER_24: No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.

1268
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:24,510
SPEAKER_24: Little Bun, behave yourself.
