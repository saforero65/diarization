142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
SPEAKER_09: I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480
SPEAKER_09: Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_09: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_09: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049

SPEAKER_09: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_09: We're off to the next house.

481
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:46,329
SPEAKER_09: We are not going to liberate Taiwan?

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_09: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_09: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_09: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_09: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_09: Let her go!

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_09: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_09: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_09: No!

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_09: You can't keep them. Burn them!

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_09: Erxi is good with his hands.

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369

01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_09: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_09: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1181
02:01:34,449 --> 02:01:36,810
SPEAKER_09: Don't panic. Think of something.

1182
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:40,979
SPEAKER_09: We're just students.
We don't know what to do.

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_09: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
