278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_21: What a bloodbath.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_21: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_21: No one's looking after them?

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_21: Was it from some dead officer?

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_21: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_21: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_21: The Reds must be on the attack.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_21: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_21: and you'll be shot.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_21: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_21: You want to go home, don't run.

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_21: How?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_21: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_21: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_21: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_21: Just put those hands up.

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_21: The coat's from my brother's unit.
