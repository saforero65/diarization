20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
SPEAKER_02: Chalk it up.

21
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,150
SPEAKER_02: How much?

24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_02: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_02: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_02: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,629
SPEAKER_02: They're too tired. Been at it all night.

29
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,080
SPEAKER_02: Business is good, Mr. Xie.

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_02: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_02: It's not good for the baby.

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_02: Let me wipe your tears.

72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_02: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

73
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,730
SPEAKER_02: Fugui...

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_02: My luck's changed.

87
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,399
SPEAKER_02: Write that down. Another round.

94
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,480
SPEAKER_02: Go home, go.

95
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,590
SPEAKER_02: It's settled.

98
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,389
SPEAKER_02: Of course.

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_02: You can't just win and walk away.

130
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,330
SPEAKER_02: The game's not over yet!

146
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,529
SPEAKER_02: We'll formalize the transfer in a few days...

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,289
SPEAKER_02: and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_02: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_02: We'll settle everything then.

150
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,929
SPEAKER_02: Okay?

159
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,179
SPEAKER_02: Master Fugui, I'll take you.

227
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,970
SPEAKER_02: Just call me Fugui.

234
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,960
SPEAKER_02: "Don't Gamble" is my son's name.

235
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,789
SPEAKER_02: You mocking me?

237
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,430
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen came back with him.

238
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,869
SPEAKER_02: We almost called him "Don't Gamble."

239
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,880
SPEAKER_02: I'd like to borrow money to set up a shop.

263
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,170
SPEAKER_02: But who will look after my wife,
my kids, my old mother?

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_02: It really is booze!

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia!

343
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,190
SPEAKER_02: It's your daddy.

344
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,440
SPEAKER_02: What are you doing?

345
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,769
SPEAKER_02: Where's mommy?

350
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,510
SPEAKER_02: we sang for the Liberation Army.

351
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,179
SPEAKER_02: Suppose I was singing for her, too.

357
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,170
SPEAKER_02: I thought of you...

358
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,110
SPEAKER_02: all the time and worried...

359
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:29,820
SPEAKER_02: how you were getting by.

360
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,309
SPEAKER_02: The new government
paid for mother's burial...

368
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,070
SPEAKER_02: How come Fengxia can't talk?

369
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,369
SPEAKER_02: She was fine when I left.

370
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,679
SPEAKER_02: She can't even say "Daddy."

417
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,670
SPEAKER_02: Five bullets. Five.

418
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,699
SPEAKER_02: They shot him.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_02: Better dry it out fast.

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_02: You can leave those.

544
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,690
SPEAKER_02: Daddy will make it better.

545
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,909
SPEAKER_02: Youqing, after dinner...

546
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,599
SPEAKER_02: come see the show.

547
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_02: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_02: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
SPEAKER_02: Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_02: They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_02: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

589
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,880
SPEAKER_02: He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

590
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,539
SPEAKER_02: and we'll liberate Taiwan!

598
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,920
SPEAKER_02: Pack a lunchbox. I'll wake him.

613
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,619
SPEAKER_02: Youqing, wake up. We're nearly there.

614
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,069
SPEAKER_02: When you get there...

615
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,640
SPEAKER_02: put your dumplings in hot water.

616
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:27,810
SPEAKER_02: Make sure you make them hot enough.

617
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,310
SPEAKER_02: Cold dumplings are bad for the tummy.

618
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,680
SPEAKER_02: - Do you like dumplings?
- Yes.

619
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,310
SPEAKER_02: - Do you like meat?
- Yes.

620
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,819
SPEAKER_02: That's good.

621
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,760
SPEAKER_02: If Youqing does as daddy says...

622
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,520
SPEAKER_02: our lives will get better and better.

623
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,659
SPEAKER_02: Our family...

624
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:51,359
SPEAKER_02: is like a little chicken.

625
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,930
SPEAKER_02: When it grows up, it becomes a goose.

626
01:11:55,399 --> 01:11:58,000
SPEAKER_02: And that'll turn into a sheep.

627
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,039
SPEAKER_02: The sheep will turn into an ox.

629
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,640
SPEAKER_02: After the ox is Communism.

630
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:08,939
SPEAKER_02: And there'll be dumplings and meat
every day.

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_02: You're the District Chief?

678
01:19:18,609 --> 01:19:20,810
SPEAKER_02: It was you who killed my son?

679
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:28,520
SPEAKER_02: I had only one son, Chunsheng!

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_02: And you killed him!

718
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:40,710
SPEAKER_02: - You're eating?
- Come on in, Mr. Niu.

719
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:43,880
SPEAKER_02: - Don't let me interrupt.
- We're finished.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_02: He'd like to meet her.

752
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:44,590
SPEAKER_02: Sounds too good. Will he go for Fengxia?

753
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,329
SPEAKER_02: He's also got a handicap...

803
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:12,899
SPEAKER_02: From where?

813
01:31:06,489 --> 01:31:08,079
SPEAKER_02: Aren't you busy!

816
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,960
SPEAKER_02: We replaced the roof tiles...

817
01:31:16,029 --> 01:31:18,159
SPEAKER_02: so it wouldn't leak anymore.

825
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,600
SPEAKER_02: "The working class leads us all."

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_02: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_02: We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_02: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_02: Shall we set a date?

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_02: Anytime. You decide.

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_02: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_02: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_02: Let's sing a song!

845
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:05,659
SPEAKER_02: Nothing compares
to the Party's benevolence

846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,229
SPEAKER_02: Chairman Mao is dearer
than father and mother

847
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:18,739
SPEAKER_02: There's nothing as good as socialism

848
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,609
SPEAKER_02: No ocean as deep as class feeling

849
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:28,680
SPEAKER_02: Maoist Thought
is revolution's treasure trove

850
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:34,630
SPEAKER_02: Whoever opposes it, we take as our enemy

851
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:56,220
SPEAKER_02: Come on, you can't cry today.

868
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,409
SPEAKER_02: I'm taking Fengxia.

869
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:40,649
SPEAKER_02: I'll look after her.

876
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:58,390
SPEAKER_02: Come on inside.

877
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:00,369
SPEAKER_02: Jiazhen, make some tea.

881
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,180
SPEAKER_02: Sit with us for a bit.

882
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,479
SPEAKER_02: Don't be like that.

885
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,060
SPEAKER_02: Chunsheng came to wish Fengxia well.

886
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,340
SPEAKER_02: You can't go on avoiding him.

887
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,609
SPEAKER_02: Can't we put this behind us?

903
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:30,770
SPEAKER_02: On the mend.

911
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,489
SPEAKER_02: No wonder there's a bottle!

912
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:23,329
SPEAKER_02: Really?

916
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:38,680
SPEAKER_02: Cheers!

928
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:23,289
SPEAKER_02: Don't bring up the past.

929
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:25,800
SPEAKER_02: I was a real no-hoper.

930
01:42:25,869 --> 01:42:28,430
SPEAKER_02: But things are better now.

936
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,920
SPEAKER_02: This is great.

947
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,670
SPEAKER_02: Of course.

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_02: All my debts will have been paid.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_02: What do you mean?

976
01:46:09,289 --> 01:46:11,189
SPEAKER_02: You mustn't lose hope.

985
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,060
SPEAKER_02: Let's say we accept this money.

986
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:55,430
SPEAKER_02: Keep it for us. There's plenty of time.

993
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:26,659
SPEAKER_02: Yes, come in.

994
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:29,199
SPEAKER_02: No, thank you, I've got to go.

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_02: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1007
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,060
SPEAKER_02: She's in labor. We're on our way there.

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_02: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_02: So we've got to get going.

1093
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,880
SPEAKER_02: No, it's better if I wear it.

1094
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,479
SPEAKER_02: Let me wear it!

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_02: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_02: He's all right.

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_02: How's Fengxia?

1108
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:06,880
SPEAKER_02: Take your time. There's plenty.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_02: Can we see them?

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,760
SPEAKER_02: If you get a car from the factory...

1162
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,399
SPEAKER_02: we can drive Fengxia home.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_02: Good idea.

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_02: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_02: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_02: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_02: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_02: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,329 --> 02:01:16,520
SPEAKER_02: Quick!

1220
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,020
SPEAKER_02: I'll make lunch.

1231
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,029
SPEAKER_02: We should've bought them
on the way home.

1232
02:05:50,539 --> 02:05:52,659
SPEAKER_02: Now we've got to carry them!

1233
02:05:53,369 --> 02:05:55,399
SPEAKER_02: Careful! Don't drop them!

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_02: Are you happy?

1236
02:06:03,079 --> 02:06:04,710
SPEAKER_02: Where will they live?

1237
02:06:04,779 --> 02:06:07,720
SPEAKER_02: I'll find a home for them when we get back.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_02: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1266
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,979
SPEAKER_02: - I'll make dinner.
- I'll help.

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_02: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_02: Then they'll eat more.

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_02: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_02: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_02: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_02: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...
