196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_19: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_19: What's his name?

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_19: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_19: But I was too ashamed to see you.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_19: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_19: It's crowded with all of us here.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_19: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_19: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_19: Life won't be easy.

236
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,390
SPEAKER_19: No, his real name's Youqing.

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_19: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_19: You've looked after us.

326
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,840
SPEAKER_19: Dying like this,
their families won't even know.

327
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,719
SPEAKER_19: Fugui...

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,889
SPEAKER_19: we've got to make it back alive.

329
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,719
SPEAKER_19: And live a good life.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_19: Mother died without knowing where I was.

420
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,840
SPEAKER_19: Pumped five bullets into him.

421
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,309
SPEAKER_19: He is dead.

422
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,440
SPEAKER_19: If I hadn't lost my home to him...

423
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:33,320
SPEAKER_19: that'd have been me.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_19: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_19: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_19: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_19: You have to go smelt steel.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_19: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_19: Delivering water is fine.

767
01:26:44,859 --> 01:26:46,350
SPEAKER_19: Come inside.

768
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,140
SPEAKER_19: Have something to drink.

769
01:27:03,579 --> 01:27:05,770
SPEAKER_19: Quotations from Chairman Mao

883
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:27,260
SPEAKER_19: Come as soon as the water's ready.

884
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,670
SPEAKER_19: But here's boiled water.

904
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:32,880
SPEAKER_19: Better when you come over.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_19: Erxi, drink up.

948
01:43:41,409 --> 01:43:43,539
SPEAKER_19: There's always been a line.

949
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:47,279
SPEAKER_19: Haven't had much to do with him for years.

953
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:16,640
SPEAKER_19: Who?

964
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:31,350
SPEAKER_19: You came for this?

970
01:45:52,369 --> 01:45:53,899
SPEAKER_19: Killed herself?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_19: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_19: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_19: Have you seen her body?

977
01:46:12,989 --> 01:46:15,460
SPEAKER_19: Don't go getting any stupid ideas.

978
01:46:17,729 --> 01:46:20,170
SPEAKER_19: You must bear it, no matter what!

979
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,470
SPEAKER_19: You can't take that road yourself.

980
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,270
SPEAKER_19: I don't want to live anymore!

987
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,869
SPEAKER_19: I know how difficult it must be...

988
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:06,140
SPEAKER_19: but you've got to pull through...

989
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:09,180
SPEAKER_19: you've got to bear it!

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_19: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_19: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_19: I'll go buy some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_19: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_19: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_19: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_19: What name do you like?

1144
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:33,130
SPEAKER_19: Please, comrade, just one peek?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_19: He ate too quickly.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_19: We shouldn't have given him water.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_19: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_19: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_19: And soon they'll grow up.

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_19: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_19: and life will get better and better.
