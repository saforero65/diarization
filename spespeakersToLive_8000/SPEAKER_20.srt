44
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,350
SPEAKER_20: Welcome home, sir.

45
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,620
SPEAKER_20: Dad!

46
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,660
SPEAKER_20: Degenerate! Another night gambling!

71
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,899
SPEAKER_20: I'm not your father. I can't be fooled.

74
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,879
SPEAKER_20: I've said all there is to say.

75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,009
SPEAKER_20: Can't you listen just this once?
Quit gambling.

76
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,110
SPEAKER_20: It's like kicking an opium habit, you know.

77
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,120
SPEAKER_20: Too fast, and boing, you snap!
Could kill you.

80
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,459
SPEAKER_20: Please.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,689
SPEAKER_20: I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,470
SPEAKER_20: Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,700
SPEAKER_20: Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,509
SPEAKER_20: Tell me.

103
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,980
SPEAKER_20: Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,919
SPEAKER_20: Come home.

152
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,620
SPEAKER_20: Fugui...

153
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,960
SPEAKER_20: I just wanted to tell you...

154
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,360
SPEAKER_20: I've realized...

155
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,340
SPEAKER_20: you'll never change. I can't live like this.

156
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,600
SPEAKER_20: I'm taking Fengxia with me.

157
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,659
SPEAKER_20: If the baby is a boy...

158
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,490
SPEAKER_20: I won't let him be like you.

191
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,549
SPEAKER_20: Granny!

192
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,049
SPEAKER_20: Jiazhen's come home.

193
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,450
SPEAKER_20: Jiazhen.

194
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,549
SPEAKER_20: Come look at your son.

195
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:16,990
SPEAKER_20: He looks like you.

196
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,759
SPEAKER_20: No, like Jiazhen.

197
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,529
SPEAKER_20: What's his name?

198
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,789
SPEAKER_20: "Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,730
SPEAKER_20: He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,329
SPEAKER_20: Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,759
SPEAKER_20: Me.

202
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,509
SPEAKER_20: Very good, very good.

203
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:37,509
SPEAKER_20: I don't gamble now. Not even in my next life.

204
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,450
SPEAKER_20: I know. Or I wouldn't have come back.

205
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,450
SPEAKER_20: Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,619
SPEAKER_20: I was just teasing Fugui. It's Youqing.

208
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,160
SPEAKER_20: Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

218
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,569
SPEAKER_20: Dad didn't give me much money...

219
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,279
SPEAKER_20: but she needs a doctor.

220
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,140
SPEAKER_20: We'll work something out.

221
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,640
SPEAKER_20: I'll borrow money to set up a shop.

224
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,509
SPEAKER_20: All I ask is a quiet life together.

352
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,920
SPEAKER_20: She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,849
SPEAKER_20: kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,570
SPEAKER_20: You should have written.

361
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,659
SPEAKER_20: and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,489
SPEAKER_20: I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,929
SPEAKER_20: Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,519
SPEAKER_20: The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,789
SPEAKER_20: It's been hard on the kids.

367
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,869
SPEAKER_20: a good night's sleep.

371
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,449
SPEAKER_20: In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,019
SPEAKER_20: For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,260
SPEAKER_20: No one thought she'd pull through.

374
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,849
SPEAKER_20: When the fever came down...

375
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,059
SPEAKER_20: she'd lost her voice.

376
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,460
SPEAKER_20: You're here.

404
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,150
SPEAKER_20: Counterrevolutionary timber.

427
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,730
SPEAKER_20: Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,070
SPEAKER_20: Ordinary townspeople.

435
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,800
SPEAKER_20: Of course.

436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,969
SPEAKER_20: Poor townspeople.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_20: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,579
SPEAKER_20: Get a frame for it tomorrow.

471
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:12,570
SPEAKER_20: The workers deserve entertaining,
don't they?

472
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:15,900
SPEAKER_20: You know, I sang for the Liberation Army...

473
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:18,510
SPEAKER_20: and after that...

493
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,900
SPEAKER_20: That's a big bowl, Youqing.

537
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,380
SPEAKER_20: What do you know?

538
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:41,150
SPEAKER_20: Kids had been bullying Fengxia.
He was defending her.

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,869
SPEAKER_20: Do you think I'd let this family go to ruin?

540
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,860
SPEAKER_20: I've stuck with you through good and bad.

541
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,840
SPEAKER_20: Have I ever complained?

542
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:38,780
SPEAKER_20: Poor Fengxia.
Can't even talk back to bullies.

543
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,420
SPEAKER_20: Youqing adores her. And you'd hit him.

559
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,750
SPEAKER_20: Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,110
SPEAKER_20: Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,409
SPEAKER_20: Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,599
SPEAKER_20: Take him tea full of vinegar.

563
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,869
SPEAKER_20: That will teach him.

650
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:35,449
SPEAKER_20: Mommy's made you more...

651
01:16:37,819 --> 01:16:39,449
SPEAKER_20: twenty this time.

652
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,880
SPEAKER_20: That should be enough.

653
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:46,289
SPEAKER_20: Once you've eaten...

654
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,489
SPEAKER_20: you can sleep...

655
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:51,590
SPEAKER_20: a nice, deep sleep.

656
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,739
SPEAKER_20: In life, you never had a good night's sleep.

657
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:02,640
SPEAKER_20: So sleep well now.

658
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:08,220
SPEAKER_20: Mommy will come see you every day.

660
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:23,289
SPEAKER_20: I shouldn't have let you go to school.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,430
SPEAKER_20: I should've kept your dad...

662
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:29,600
SPEAKER_20: from making you go.

664
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,680
SPEAKER_20: If only I'd stopped him.

668
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,989
SPEAKER_20: The one who ran over my son?

689
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,319
SPEAKER_20: No one wants your money.

690
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,890
SPEAKER_20: I want my son. Give me back my son.

691
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,100
SPEAKER_20: You killed him! Give him back to me!

695
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,479
SPEAKER_20: You killed him.

745
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,390
SPEAKER_20: I'll tell you about him.

746
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,100
SPEAKER_20: Let's not let her in on it for now.

773
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,890
SPEAKER_20: Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.

774
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,520
SPEAKER_20: A good family.

775
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:27,100
SPEAKER_20: The Liberation Army
gave me that certificate.

790
01:28:57,529 --> 01:29:00,020
SPEAKER_20: Who's to say he'll like our Fengxia?

791
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,760
SPEAKER_20: He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.

805
01:30:16,609 --> 01:30:18,159
SPEAKER_20: You'd better hurry back.

806
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,569
SPEAKER_20: A cripple?

807
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:21,539
SPEAKER_20: Must be Wan Erxi!

808
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,310
SPEAKER_20: He doesn't like Fengxia,
so he tears the place down.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_20: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_20: Shall we set a date?

837
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,340
SPEAKER_20: Fengxia's had a hard life.

838
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,109
SPEAKER_20: If you don't mind...

839
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,010
SPEAKER_20: let's make the wedding a real occasion.

840
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,920
SPEAKER_20: To make her happy.

852
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:00,319
SPEAKER_20: They're all singing for Fengxia...

853
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:03,479
SPEAKER_20: and she can't even join in!

880
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,649
SPEAKER_20: Water's not boiled.

894
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:36,130
SPEAKER_20: Give it back to him.

895
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,630
SPEAKER_20: I don't want his gifts.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_20: But it's Chairman Mao.

905
01:40:33,989 --> 01:40:35,510
SPEAKER_20: Have you eaten?

917
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:48,460
SPEAKER_20: Erxi, when you went to the hospital today...

918
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,560
SPEAKER_20: what did they say about Fengxia's health?

920
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,000
SPEAKER_20: Still, you can't be too careful.

921
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,829
SPEAKER_20: Your folks aren't around.

922
01:41:58,909 --> 01:42:02,069
SPEAKER_20: After the birth,
you'll stay with us for a while.

923
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:07,609
SPEAKER_20: Spend as much time as you can with her.

924
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:11,149
SPEAKER_20: When I was pregnant with Fengxia...

925
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,449
SPEAKER_20: her dad was never around.

927
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,680
SPEAKER_20: Very!

937
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,529
SPEAKER_20: After the child is born...

938
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,399
SPEAKER_20: have a photo taken every year.

991
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:22,220
SPEAKER_20: Chunsheng, it's cold.

992
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:24,399
SPEAKER_20: Come inside.

1003
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:25,989
SPEAKER_20: Fengxia's about to have a baby.
It's to thank the matchmaker!

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_20: Another working class member on the way!

1009
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:40,829
SPEAKER_20: So we've got to get going.

1010
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,779
SPEAKER_20: We'll bring the baby to see you.

1023
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:33,449
SPEAKER_20: When will they let you return?

1032
01:50:13,670 --> 01:50:15,359
SPEAKER_20: When is it due?

1050
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:26,840
SPEAKER_20: They're all so young.

1051
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:29,000
SPEAKER_20: Are they nurses?

1057
01:51:39,489 --> 01:51:41,579
SPEAKER_20: We must find a good doctor.

1067
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:24,899
SPEAKER_20: Fengxia's a mute.

1068
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,300
SPEAKER_20: Can these young people cope?

1084
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:49,510
SPEAKER_20: Don't move.

1095
01:54:41,970 --> 01:54:43,199
SPEAKER_20: Go ask.

1102
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:49,029
SPEAKER_20: They've gone to eat.

1104
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:52,470
SPEAKER_20: They say she's fine.

1105
01:55:52,909 --> 01:55:53,899
SPEAKER_20: Want one?

1106
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,069
SPEAKER_20: Give them to Dr. Wang.

1109
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:24,060
SPEAKER_20: Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?

1111
01:56:27,869 --> 01:56:29,899
SPEAKER_20: Will the baby be crippled?

1116
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,390
SPEAKER_20: What name do you like?

1117
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,729
SPEAKER_20: "Don't Gamble."

1123
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,350
SPEAKER_20: But it's a tradition.

1124
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,949
SPEAKER_20: Cat, Dog or Little Bun...

1125
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,020
SPEAKER_20: are not recorded in the Register of Names.

1126
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:24,189
SPEAKER_20: He'd know for sure.

1127
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,789
SPEAKER_20: He doesn't know those kids exist...

1128
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:30,000
SPEAKER_20: so they don't die.

1129
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,829
SPEAKER_20: That's what the old folks say.

1130
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:37,739
SPEAKER_20: Okay, then Little Bun it is.

1131
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:40,109
SPEAKER_20: For now, anyway.

1132
01:57:41,149 --> 01:57:44,409
SPEAKER_20: Later, his dad can give him a proper name.

1136
01:58:13,779 --> 01:58:15,649
SPEAKER_20: We said it would be fine!

1137
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,310
SPEAKER_20: Comrade, how's my daughter?

1138
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:20,380
SPEAKER_20: Fine. Mother and son are fine.

1139
01:58:20,449 --> 01:58:22,510
SPEAKER_20: Is he normal?

1140
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,680
SPEAKER_20: Absolutely.

1164
01:59:53,949 --> 01:59:57,439
SPEAKER_20: Erxi, seeing as they are both fine...

1165
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,850
SPEAKER_20: why don't you see Dr. Wang back.

1172
02:00:40,989 --> 02:00:42,590
SPEAKER_20: Have some water.

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,579
SPEAKER_20: Some water should help.

1217
02:04:56,279 --> 02:04:58,010
SPEAKER_20: Such a good little boy.

1218
02:04:58,079 --> 02:04:59,850
SPEAKER_20: Ten whole thermoses.

1225
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:24,609
SPEAKER_20: I want to visit Fengxia's grave again...

1226
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:28,310
SPEAKER_20: and take Little Bun's photos...

1227
02:05:28,979 --> 02:05:30,510
SPEAKER_20: to show her.

1228
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,149
SPEAKER_20: He's another year older.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_20: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_20: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1243
02:06:39,289 --> 02:06:40,979
SPEAKER_20: What a clever boy!

1245
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:48,619
SPEAKER_20: Before you were born...

1246
02:06:49,729 --> 02:06:51,890
SPEAKER_20: Granny said to mommy that...

1247
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:55,069
SPEAKER_20: she should take a photo every year.

1252
02:07:09,119 --> 02:07:11,449
SPEAKER_20: He always carries on like this.

1261
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:41,779
SPEAKER_20: won't eat buns, only rice now?

1265
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,949
SPEAKER_20: What a food bill he must have.

1287
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,829
SPEAKER_20: You will ride on an ox's back.
