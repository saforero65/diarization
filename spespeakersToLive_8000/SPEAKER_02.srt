116
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,649
SPEAKER_02: Well?

117
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,360
SPEAKER_02: Master Fugui, you're out of the game.

171
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,500
SPEAKER_02: The Xu family home...

172
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,099
SPEAKER_02: goes to Long'er.

173
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,640
SPEAKER_02: And the debt is hereby settled.

278
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,039
SPEAKER_02: What a bloodbath.

279
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,410
SPEAKER_02: What's that sound?

280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,549
SPEAKER_02: The wounded.

296
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,089
SPEAKER_02: We must help each other.

297
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,819
SPEAKER_02: Besides, we're from the same town.

308
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,570
SPEAKER_02: Wait right here.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_02: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_02: and you'll be shot.

311
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,550
SPEAKER_02: Better to wait and become a POW.

312
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,019
SPEAKER_02: The Reds send POWs home.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_02: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_02: You want to go home, don't run.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_02: Just put those hands up.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_02: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_02: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_02: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_02: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

405
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,429
SPEAKER_02: Of course. You're you, he's him.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_02: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_02: We are setting up communal kitchens.

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_02: just come to the canteen.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_02: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_02: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_02: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_02: But that's wood.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_02: We are less politically aware than your son.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_02: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_02: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_02: How can I ever make it up?

686
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,489
SPEAKER_02: Take this for now.

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_02: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399
SPEAKER_02: Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_02: begin their wedded life.

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_02: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1005
01:48:27,789 --> 01:48:29,279
SPEAKER_02: Time does fly!

1006
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,199
SPEAKER_02: Erxi sent word from the hospital.

1011
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,899
SPEAKER_02: - But you won't stay?
- No, thanks.

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_02: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_02: They say I'm a capitalist.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_02: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.
