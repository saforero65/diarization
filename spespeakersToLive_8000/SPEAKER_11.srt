24
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,840
SPEAKER_11: But my calligraphy's improving.

25
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,689
SPEAKER_11: Long'er, you neglect your troupe.

26
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:24,129
SPEAKER_11: But not my money.
They sound like a pack of mules.

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,629
SPEAKER_11: They're too tired. Been at it all night.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_11: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_11: But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
SPEAKER_11: Let's put the past behind us...

212
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,009
SPEAKER_11: and live peacefully.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_11: It's crowded with all of us here.

215
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,789
SPEAKER_11: I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

342
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,650
SPEAKER_11: Fengxia!

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_11: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_11: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_11: Wake up.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_11: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_11: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

794
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,250
SPEAKER_11: I think she likes him.

795
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,779
SPEAKER_11: It's different from before. Look.

796
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,460
SPEAKER_11: Go ask Mr. Niu...

797
01:29:39,529 --> 01:29:41,300
SPEAKER_11: what the boy thinks.

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_11: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_11: You haven't seen any doctors?

1055
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,239
SPEAKER_11: No.

1056
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,310
SPEAKER_11: Go ask where the doctors are.

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_11: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_11: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_11: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_11: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_11: I'll go buy some buns.

1101
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:47,199
SPEAKER_11: Where's Erxi?

1103
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,600
SPEAKER_11: How's Fengxia?

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_11: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_11: to think of a name for the kid?

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_11: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_11: That's not a name!

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_11: Can we see them?

1175
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,810
SPEAKER_11: Why'd he do that?

1176
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,180
SPEAKER_11: He's been locked up without food.
He scoffed those buns.

1177
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,380
SPEAKER_11: Drink it slowly.

1178
02:01:10,359 --> 02:01:11,579
SPEAKER_11: Help us!

1179
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:15,250
SPEAKER_11: She's bleeding! We don't know what to do.

1180
02:01:15,329 --> 02:01:16,520
SPEAKER_11: Quick!

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_11: Little Bun...

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_11: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_11: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_11: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_11: He's a professor, after all.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_11: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_11: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_11: It's much too much.

1260
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:38,510
SPEAKER_11: Erxi, is it true that Dr. Wang...

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_11: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_11: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_11: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_11: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_11: And soon they'll grow up.

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_11: And then...

1280
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:18,770
SPEAKER_11: the chickens will turn into geese...

1281
02:09:18,909 --> 02:09:21,539
SPEAKER_11: and the geese will turn into sheep...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_11: and the sheep will turn into oxen.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_11: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_11: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_11: and life will get better and better.
