SPEAKER_21: What's wrong?

416
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,340
SPEAKER_21: Why are your pants wet?

425
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,650
SPEAKER_21: Landlords?

439
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,050
SPEAKER_21: I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,719

455
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:06,710
SPEAKER_21: If you take all our pots away,
how will we cook?

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_21: We're off to the next house.

481
00:54:43,809 --> 00:54:46,329

SPEAKER_21: Should we add chili?

567
01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:40,820
SPEAKER_21: Good, it'll be hot and sour soup.

602

692
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,970
SPEAKER_21: Go away!

693
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,640
SPEAKER_21: Remember, you owe us a life.

694
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,380

SPEAKER_21: Yes, and run if he has to.

757

SPEAKER_21: He can run?

758
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:00,949
SPEAKER_21: Was he born a cripple?

781
01:28:20,989 --> 01:28:23,220
SPEAKER_21: Have something to eat first. Lunch is ready.

782

SPEAKER_21: How's this for Fengxia?

799
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:00,890
SPEAKER_21: Comrade, could I look at that one?

811
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:33,079
SPEAKER_21: We'd better hurry.

812
01:30:33,149 --> 01:30:35,180
