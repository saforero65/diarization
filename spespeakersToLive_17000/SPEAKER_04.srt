SPEAKER_04: Go wait in the corridor.

1064
01:52:03,479 --> 01:52:06,930

We've overthrown them.

1065
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:10,609

1186
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,960
SPEAKER_04: He'll know.

1188
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,770
SPEAKER_04: What's wrong with him? What happened?

1209
02:04:30,189 --> 02:04:32,680
SPEAKER_04: Grandpa! It's crooked again.

1213
02:04:45,739 --> 02:04:47,800

1235
02:05:59,909 --> 02:06:02,470
SPEAKER_04: Grandpa, where will the chicks live?

1238
02:06:25,970 --> 02:06:27,729
SPEAKER_04: Youqing eats dumplings.

1239
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:29,800
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia looks at photos.

1240
02:06:30,439 --> 02:06:33,710
SPEAKER_04: Little Bun, do you know who Youqing is?

1244
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,779
SPEAKER_04: Granny, why all the photos for Fengxia?

1269
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:28,789
SPEAKER_04: Grandpa, where'll we put the chicks?

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_04: Let's see.

1276
02:09:05,329 --> 02:09:08,060

02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_04: And then...

1283
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:27,310
SPEAKER_04: And after the oxen?

1284
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:30,079
SPEAKER_04: After oxen...

1285
02:09:32,189 --> 02:09:35,319
SPEAKER_04: After oxen, Little Bun will grow up.

1286
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,489
