397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_08: He refused, beat up a cadre...

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_08: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_08: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_08: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_08: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_08: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_08: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_08: I think you should go, Chief.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_08: Everyone knows about them.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_08: Don't you see what they are?

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_08: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_08: Classic feudal types.

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_08: Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,930
SPEAKER_08: Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_08: Fetch a brazier.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_08: I've found just the man for her.

748
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:30,909
SPEAKER_08: His name is Wan Erxi.

749
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:34,750
SPEAKER_08: He works in a factory in the county seat.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
SPEAKER_08: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_08: Yes, and run if he has to.

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
SPEAKER_08: No, it was an accident at work.

760
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,979
SPEAKER_08: He gets compensation.

761
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,489
SPEAKER_08: Shall we invite him over?
Fengxia can check him out.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_08: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
SPEAKER_08: Where's Fengxia?

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_08: Comrade Fengxia.

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_08: Fengxia's about to give birth?
