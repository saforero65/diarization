112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_09: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_09: Get out of my sight!

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_09: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_09: We'll settle everything then.

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_09: What happened? No one's left?

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_09: This is too much.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_09: I'll hit him again if I have to.

534
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,099
SPEAKER_09: Sit then. Right in front of me!

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_09: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_09: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_09: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_09: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

831
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:14,779
SPEAKER_09: Please come again.

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489
SPEAKER_09: What do you think about Fengxia and me?

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_09: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_09: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_09: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_09: Can't you see?

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_09: Do you hear him?

1168
02:00:16,500 --> 02:00:18,529
SPEAKER_09: Did he eat all seven buns?

1169
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:21,130
SPEAKER_09: Yes, just gobbled them up.
