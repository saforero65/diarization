439
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,851
SPEAKER_05: The strange thing was that I didn’t
notice her as worried as I was.

440
00:55:56,152 --> 00:56:00,389
SPEAKER_05: If I wake up mute I would
probably go crazy.

441
00:56:00,556 --> 00:56:04,460
SPEAKER_05: I noticed it was an attitude
that she was assuming.

442
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:08,063
SPEAKER_05: I could never knew if was just
in front of me or everyone

443
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:09,565
SPEAKER_05: or facing life.

444
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,235
SPEAKER_05: Maybe she was punishing us all.

445
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:15,871
SPEAKER_05: But then she stopped speaking.

446
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,876
SPEAKER_05: I don’t think she can’t speak,
I think that she has decided not to speak.

447
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,980
SPEAKER_05: And I think it’s a voluntary decision.

448
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:28,650
SPEAKER_05: I thought, however, that it
could be a medical issue.

450
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:37,626
SPEAKER_05: I talked to Héctor, to César 
and to other people.

452
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,632
SPEAKER_05: They all came to the
same conclusion:

453
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,336
SPEAKER_05: Aracelly's problem
is inexplicable.

454
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:53,041
SPEAKER_05: It’s not physiological, and it
doesn’t seem psychological either.

455
00:56:53,342 --> 00:56:57,447
SPEAKER_05: Always, always, always, I think
that she always understands us.

456
00:56:57,646 --> 00:57:00,849
SPEAKER_05: She hasn't lost the
capacity of understanding

457
00:57:00,949 --> 00:57:04,820
SPEAKER_05: nor has she lost any
other kind of routines.

458
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,724
SPEAKER_05: She reads, she walks, she thinks,

459
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:11,661
SPEAKER_05: she insinuates, she takes initiatives.

461
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:21,237
SPEAKER_05: And I think that, somehow, what she’s pretending
is to make life unbearable to everyone.

465
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,614
SPEAKER_05: I think that families begin

472
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:03,545
SPEAKER_05: but to live academically,
and that we have lacked.
