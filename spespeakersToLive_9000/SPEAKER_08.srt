72
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,459
SPEAKER_08: All right, do it yourself. But please don't cry.

90
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,250
SPEAKER_08: Well?

105
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,879
SPEAKER_08: Why don't you go home?
There'll be other times.

106
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,450
SPEAKER_08: Your wife is right here.

107
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,559
SPEAKER_08: What's with you?
Can't take "no" for an answer?

108
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,360
SPEAKER_08: You want to make me lose face? Go away!

175
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,740
SPEAKER_08: I thought I'd live my final days here.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_08: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_08: But I was too ashamed to see you.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
SPEAKER_08: Let's put the past behind us...

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_08: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_08: It's crowded with all of us here.

215
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,789
SPEAKER_08: I'll tidy up tomorrow. We'll be fine.

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_08: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_08: You've looked after us.

346
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,519
SPEAKER_08: I'm home.

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_08: But it's not just that.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_08: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_08: The District Chief has come.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_08: I've found just the man for her.

762
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,029
SPEAKER_08: Does she mind us playing matchmaker?

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,899
SPEAKER_08: She's not opposed,
she does fret about leaving us.

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,289
SPEAKER_08: Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_08: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_08: Solid working class stock.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_08: I approve.

872
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:41,109
SPEAKER_08: Chunsheng.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_08: Erxi, drink up.

959
01:45:08,359 --> 01:45:09,489
SPEAKER_08: Well?

971
01:45:54,909 --> 01:45:55,970
SPEAKER_08: Why?

972
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:58,829
SPEAKER_08: I don't know.

973
01:45:58,979 --> 01:46:00,909
SPEAKER_08: Have you seen her body?

1096
01:54:50,010 --> 01:54:52,069
SPEAKER_08: I'm just going to see him.

1097
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:11,449
SPEAKER_08: He's all right.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_08: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_08: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_08: I'll go buy some buns.

1107
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,729
SPEAKER_08: Dr. Wang, have some buns.

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_08: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_08: What name do you like?

1253
02:07:11,979 --> 02:07:13,350
SPEAKER_08: It's okay.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_08: We shouldn't have given him water.

1271
02:08:43,510 --> 02:08:45,199
SPEAKER_08: How about in here?

1272
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,310
SPEAKER_08: This box is bigger, isn't it?

1273
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,979
SPEAKER_08: They'll have more room to run around.

1274
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:54,949
SPEAKER_08: Then they'll eat more.

1275
02:08:57,090 --> 02:08:59,109
SPEAKER_08: And soon they'll grow up.

1279
02:09:12,270 --> 02:09:13,670
SPEAKER_08: And then...

1282
02:09:21,949 --> 02:09:25,010
SPEAKER_08: and the sheep will turn into oxen.
