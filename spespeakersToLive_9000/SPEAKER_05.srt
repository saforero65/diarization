28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,340
SPEAKER_05: Why don't you have a go?
Show them what it takes.

37
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,800
SPEAKER_05: One more night like this...

38
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:19,209
SPEAKER_05: you'll have him right where you want him.

85
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,759
SPEAKER_05: Your win, Master Fugui.

124
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,149
SPEAKER_05: It's all in order, I'll be going.

125
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,379
SPEAKER_05: Master Fugui, don't think badly of me...

127
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,590
SPEAKER_05: But I sure like that mansion of yours.

128
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,230
SPEAKER_05: See you there in a few days.

189
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,349
SPEAKER_05: Want me to help you?

225
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,960
SPEAKER_05: A rare visitor indeed.

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_05: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_05: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

780
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:20,920
SPEAKER_05: I'll be going.

813
01:31:06,489 --> 01:31:08,079
SPEAKER_05: Aren't you busy!

814
01:31:08,659 --> 01:31:10,680
SPEAKER_05: I brought some colleagues.

815
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,779
SPEAKER_05: We're fixing the place up.

816
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,960
SPEAKER_05: We replaced the roof tiles...

817
01:31:16,029 --> 01:31:18,159
SPEAKER_05: so it wouldn't leak anymore.

818
01:31:18,529 --> 01:31:21,369
SPEAKER_05: And we've painted Chairman Mao's portrait.

819
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:25,270
SPEAKER_05: Fengxia helped us.

829
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:04,810
SPEAKER_05: Thanks, we'll go to the factory bathhouse.

831
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:14,779
SPEAKER_05: Please come again.

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489
SPEAKER_05: What do you think about Fengxia and me?

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_05: Anytime. You decide.

867
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,479
SPEAKER_05: Dad, Mom...

868
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,409
SPEAKER_05: I'm taking Fengxia.

869
01:36:38,689 --> 01:36:40,649
SPEAKER_05: I'll look after her.

907
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:40,220
SPEAKER_05: Lunch is all taken care of.

908
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:50,100
SPEAKER_05: Help me with the table.

910
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:17,659
SPEAKER_05: Dad, Mom, we're having a baby.

916
01:41:37,489 --> 01:41:38,680
SPEAKER_05: Cheers!

919
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:53,890
SPEAKER_05: That she's in terrific shape.

1030
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:08,390
SPEAKER_05: Everything's fine and normal.

1031
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:12,460
SPEAKER_05: They say she's great. No problems.

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_05: From the contractions, not right now.

1034
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:23,710
SPEAKER_05: Fengxia, don't be nervous.

1055
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,239
SPEAKER_05: No.

1056
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:39,310
SPEAKER_05: Go ask where the doctors are.

1058
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,550
SPEAKER_05: They've been locked away.

1072
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,710
SPEAKER_05: Let me think.

1076
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,359
SPEAKER_05: me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1088
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,029
SPEAKER_05: Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.

1089
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:19,439
SPEAKER_05: I was putting on a show.

1090
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,699
SPEAKER_05: We're not accusing you.

1091
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:23,770
SPEAKER_05: My wife's having a baby.

1092
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,350
SPEAKER_05: I wanted you here for her sake.

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_05: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,760
SPEAKER_05: If you get a car from the factory...

1162
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,399
SPEAKER_05: we can drive Fengxia home.

1171
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:28,539
SPEAKER_05: You two get the car, we'll be fine.

1231
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:50,029
SPEAKER_05: We should've bought them
on the way home.

1232
02:05:50,539 --> 02:05:52,659
SPEAKER_05: Now we've got to carry them!

1266
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,979
SPEAKER_05: - I'll make dinner.
- I'll help.

1267
02:08:17,779 --> 02:08:21,010
SPEAKER_05: No, you're tired. You two have a rest.
I'll do it.

1268
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:24,510
SPEAKER_05: Little Bun, behave yourself.
