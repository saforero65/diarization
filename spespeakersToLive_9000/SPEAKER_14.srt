41
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,220
SPEAKER_14: Master Fugui is going home. You take him.

42
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,459
SPEAKER_14: Take care.

58
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,449
SPEAKER_14: - What'd he just say?
- Nothing. Eat.

64
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,370
SPEAKER_14: Don't cry.

65
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,769
SPEAKER_14: It's not good for the baby.

102
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,740
SPEAKER_14: Come, give Mrs. Xu a seat.

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_14: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_14: Get out of my sight!

131
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:12,710
SPEAKER_14: Master Fugui, I'm sorry...

132
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,769
SPEAKER_14: but you've nothing left.
What would you wager?

133
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,809
SPEAKER_14: If you're unhappy, talk to Mr. Xie.

135
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,950
SPEAKER_14: What are you doing?

136
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:26,110
SPEAKER_14: It's not over yet!

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_14: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

140
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,769
SPEAKER_14: I am very sorry, but you've got nothing left.

141
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,779
SPEAKER_14: What could you stake the bet on?
We don't accept empty bets.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_14: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

145
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,120
SPEAKER_14: Not that we'd accept it as ante.

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,289
SPEAKER_14: and explain to your old man.

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_14: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_14: We'll settle everything then.

150
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,929
SPEAKER_14: Okay?

163
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,400
SPEAKER_14: Mr. Xu, any mistakes?

183
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,660
SPEAKER_14: It's valuable. Don't scratch it. Take it slowly.

184
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,789
SPEAKER_14: Careful, slowly. Don't move too fast!

185
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,930
SPEAKER_14: Don't break anything!

186
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,500
SPEAKER_14: Your mother's not well.
Go now, for her sake.

228
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,769
SPEAKER_14: This old home of yours is great.

229
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,369
SPEAKER_14: Warm in winter, cool in summer.

230
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,470
SPEAKER_14: Great at any price.

231
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,009
SPEAKER_14: I've given up the puppet troupe.

232
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,519
SPEAKER_14: Have a seat.

233
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,990
SPEAKER_14: I don't gamble anymore.
Don't want to end up like you.

256
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,769
SPEAKER_14: Might never go home again.

257
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,220
SPEAKER_14: What are you looking at?

258
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:32,890
SPEAKER_14: Thinking of escaping?

259
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:37,130
SPEAKER_14: The Nationalists will shoot you.

275
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,619
SPEAKER_14: Get it out of my sight then.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_14: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_14: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170
SPEAKER_14: Take this.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_14: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

289
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,220
SPEAKER_14: The wounded who froze to death.

290
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,420
SPEAKER_14: Put it on. We must survive.

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_14: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,589
SPEAKER_14: They've all run off.

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
SPEAKER_14: How could that be?

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_14: How?

332
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:13,780
SPEAKER_14: - On one of the wounded.
- It's a killing field.

487
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:58,269
SPEAKER_14: Big ambition for a little kid.

488
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,539
SPEAKER_14: It's more than enough.

489
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,570
SPEAKER_14: So gobble away. Help yourself to sauces.

490
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,010
SPEAKER_14: Youqing, I'll help you stir that up.

491
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:15,820
SPEAKER_14: What a big appetite!

492
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,329
SPEAKER_14: And so much chili sauce!

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_14: How could you?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_14: What is this?

500
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,320
SPEAKER_14: Look at all the chili sauce.
Let me see your eyes.

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_14: This is too much.

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_14: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_14: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_14: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_14: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_14: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_14: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_14: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

631
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,670
SPEAKER_14: It's Fugui's son?

632
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,649
SPEAKER_14: District Chief arrived after dark.

633
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,079
SPEAKER_14: He backed up,
and his jeep knocked the wall down.

634
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:19,020
SPEAKER_14: Youqing was sleeping on the other side.

635
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,850
SPEAKER_14: When the wall collapsed...

636
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,159
SPEAKER_14: he didn't have a chance.

637
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:26,560
SPEAKER_14: The District Chief was hurt, too.

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_14: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_14: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_14: How can I ever make it up?

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_14: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_14: Let her go!

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_14: You can't keep them. Burn them!

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_14: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_14: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_14: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

820
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,510
SPEAKER_14: You're just in time. We've just finished.

821
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,010
SPEAKER_14: - Don't rush off!
- I'll make you something to eat.

822
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,449
SPEAKER_14: We must be going.

823
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:42,920
SPEAKER_14: Do stay! Come on inside.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_14: Erxi painted this.

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_14: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_14: Hold your little Red Books.

858
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,180
SPEAKER_14: Clear a path! Ship sailing through!

863
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:17,989
SPEAKER_14: Chairman Mao...

864
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:21,600
SPEAKER_14: Comrade Fengxia's mine now.

897
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:06,279
SPEAKER_14: Dad! Mom!

906
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,409
SPEAKER_14: I'll make something.

934
01:42:41,649 --> 01:42:43,579
SPEAKER_14: I had the photo framed.

935
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,260
SPEAKER_14: We haven't taken a photo in years.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_14: Can't you see?

1043
01:50:54,909 --> 01:50:56,640
SPEAKER_14: Everything will be fine.

1044
01:50:56,939 --> 01:50:59,970
SPEAKER_14: What's this about pushing?
Too early for pushing!

1045
01:51:00,409 --> 01:51:03,750
SPEAKER_14: And what's this shouting? Out!

1077
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,359
SPEAKER_14: How vile can you get?

1078
01:53:31,029 --> 01:53:33,159
SPEAKER_14: We dragged him here today...

1079
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:36,270
SPEAKER_14: to educate him, to criticize him...

1080
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,899
SPEAKER_14: and to let him witness her giving birth.

1081
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,909
SPEAKER_14: To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_14: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_14: Do you hear him?

1151
01:59:13,539 --> 01:59:15,529
SPEAKER_14: Please, I'm the father!

1154
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:27,020
SPEAKER_14: We'll see them soon.

1156
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:32,279
SPEAKER_14: Yes, 7.9 pounds!

1157
01:59:32,659 --> 01:59:35,289
SPEAKER_14: - How is he?
- They're both fine!

1158
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:37,689
SPEAKER_14: Erxi, you're a lucky man!

1159
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,890
SPEAKER_14: My son was only 5.5 pounds.

1163
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,010
SPEAKER_14: Good idea.

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_14: He gobbled up seven buns.

1203
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:58,659
SPEAKER_14: Oxygen.
