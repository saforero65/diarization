53
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,949
SPEAKER_07: Little bastards from big bastards grow.

54
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,519
SPEAKER_07: I learned all I know from you.

55
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:49,360
SPEAKER_07: How do you think we lost
most of what we had in the first place?

56
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,529
SPEAKER_07: You're the one they call big bastard, Xu,
not me!

59
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,939
SPEAKER_07: Mother, when you finish,
send him to his room.

109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330
SPEAKER_07: Get out!

110
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,870
SPEAKER_07: I've just...

111
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,240
SPEAKER_07: Let's play!

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_07: This can't be happening!

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_07: Sit down.

138
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,919
SPEAKER_07: - Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
SPEAKER_07: I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480
SPEAKER_07: Don't talk like that.

182
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,400
SPEAKER_07: Sir!

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_07: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_07: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_07: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

277
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,130
SPEAKER_07: They're not mine. It's how I make my living.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_07: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

300
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,380
SPEAKER_07: What happened? No one's left?

330
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,269
SPEAKER_07: Lao Quan! They're shooting!

331
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,849
SPEAKER_07: Where did you find this coat?

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_07: The coat's from my brother's unit.

334
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,360
SPEAKER_07: - What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

335
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,730
SPEAKER_07: What's your brother look like?

336
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,269
SPEAKER_07: Just like me.

337
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:53,019
SPEAKER_07: Lao Quan!

406
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,800
SPEAKER_07: Execute the revolutionary despot, Long'er!

407
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:39,800

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_07: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_07: What did you think you were doing?

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_07: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_07: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_07: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_07: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530

519
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,320
SPEAKER_07: Leave him alone! I'll kill him!

520
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,329
SPEAKER_07: Enough!

521
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,989
SPEAKER_07: How could you?

522
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
SPEAKER_07: Said he was a saboteur. I had to.

526
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,579
SPEAKER_07: I hit him for not obeying.

527
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,019
SPEAKER_07: That's no excuse.

528
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,139
SPEAKER_07: You spoil him.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_07: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_07: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

532
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:11,489
SPEAKER_07: If you indulge him, we'll all go to ruin.

533
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,900
SPEAKER_07: I'll hit him again if I have to.

554
01:03:37,929 --> 01:03:39,420
SPEAKER_07: Ask him again.

555
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,190
SPEAKER_07: Say I want him to.

556
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,199
SPEAKER_07: Youqing, daddy wants you to see the show.

569
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,360
SPEAKER_07: Youqing, is that tea for me?

570
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:58,329
SPEAKER_07: Good boy, bring it over here.

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_07: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

574
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:43,340
SPEAKER_07: He's put in chili!

575
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,690
SPEAKER_07: We've smelted our steel...

576
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,989
SPEAKER_07: and reached our production target.

577
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:54,500
SPEAKER_07: We're off to report the good news.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,219
SPEAKER_07: Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_07: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_07: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_07: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_07: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
SPEAKER_07: Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,500
SPEAKER_07: We've made enough steel
for three cannon balls.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_07: They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_07: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_07: another on his dinner table...

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_07: and the last in the toilet!

589
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,880
SPEAKER_07: He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

590
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,539
SPEAKER_07: and we'll liberate Taiwan!

591
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,359
SPEAKER_07: Xia, Youqing, have some dumplings.

592
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,970
SPEAKER_07: Let them sleep. They'll eat later.

641
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:20,439
SPEAKER_07: What's happened?

642
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,350
SPEAKER_07: Answer me!

643
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,460

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_07: And you killed him!

682
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,000
SPEAKER_07: You, behind the goddamn wheel!

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_07: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_07: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_07: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_07: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_07: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_07: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_07: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_07: No!

764
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,449

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_07: You've gone to so much trouble.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_07: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_07: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_07: Let's sing a song!

845
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:05,659
SPEAKER_07: Nothing compares
to the Party's benevolence

846
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,229
SPEAKER_07: Chairman Mao is dearer
than father and mother

847
01:34:13,069 --> 01:34:18,739
SPEAKER_07: There's nothing as good as socialism

848
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,609
SPEAKER_07: No ocean as deep as class feeling

855
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,229
SPEAKER_07: Time for a photo!

861
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,770
SPEAKER_07: Time to wrap up.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_07: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_07: What are these eggs for?

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
SPEAKER_07: Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.

1042
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:54,829
SPEAKER_07: Do as Mommy says and push.

1049
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:13,220
SPEAKER_07: Sit down.

1050
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:26,840
SPEAKER_07: They're all so young.

1189
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,310
SPEAKER_07: He's eaten too much.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_07: What do you mean?

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_07: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_07: But he was okay after the water.
