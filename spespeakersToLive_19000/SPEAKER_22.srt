282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_22: No one's looking after them?

283
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,980
SPEAKER_22: No one's left.

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_22: Was it from some dead officer?

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_22: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_22: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_22: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_22: Just put those hands up.
