68
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,389
SPEAKER_21: What are you crying for?

69
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,490
SPEAKER_21: If nothing else, can't you think of the baby?

70
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,129
SPEAKER_21: Let me wipe your tears.

209
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:06,769
SPEAKER_21: I'd heard you'd had a boy,
and were living at home.

210
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,309
SPEAKER_21: But I was too ashamed to see you.

213
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,990
SPEAKER_21: I've paid the rent with mother's jewelry.

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,390
SPEAKER_21: It's crowded with all of us here.

216
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,460
SPEAKER_21: Mother's feeling better.

217
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,329
SPEAKER_21: Normally she doesn't even get out of bed.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_21: Life won't be easy.

288
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,279
SPEAKER_21: Which corpses?

294
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:14,309
SPEAKER_21: Chunsheng and I are lucky
to meet someone as nice as you.

295
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,779
SPEAKER_21: You've looked after us.

348
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:44,000
SPEAKER_21: Mother died without knowing where I was.

349
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,010
SPEAKER_21: The day...

355
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:15,260
SPEAKER_21: Written?

356
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,000
SPEAKER_21: I never thought I'd make it back alive.

388
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:27,559
SPEAKER_21: He joined the army as a driver.
He went south with them.

389
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,130
SPEAKER_21: We won't see him for a while.

400
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,940
SPEAKER_21: He burnt it?

466
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,070
SPEAKER_21: It can't be worth much.

603
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,039
SPEAKER_21: Smelting steel is a duty.
We can't be politically backward.

604
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:22,810
SPEAKER_21: Mr. Niu praised us in front of everyone.

605
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:28,720
SPEAKER_21: Youqing has to go.

606
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,819
SPEAKER_21: Wake up.

607
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,220
SPEAKER_21: You have to go smelt steel.

610
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:50,569
SPEAKER_21: Must not be politically backward.
You can sleep later.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_21: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_21: Have 20. You should eat more.

723
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,100
SPEAKER_21: I was telling Jiazhen...

724
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,699
SPEAKER_21: that we could...

725
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,979
SPEAKER_21: do propaganda shows.

726
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,380
SPEAKER_21: Put these old things to new use.

733
01:23:56,329 --> 01:23:59,020
SPEAKER_21: They always remind Jiazhen of Youqing.

741
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,149
SPEAKER_21: Delivering water is fine.

742
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,289
SPEAKER_21: Jiazhen's health is poor.
If we're together, I can look after her.

743
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,460
SPEAKER_21: We'll discuss it later.

757
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,109
SPEAKER_21: He can run?

788
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,220
SPEAKER_21: His leg's not so bad, and he seems nice.

789
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,189
SPEAKER_21: I approve.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_21: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_21: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

932
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,229
SPEAKER_21: Erxi, drink up.

1052
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,470
SPEAKER_21: Who examined Fengxia?

1053
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:32,770
SPEAKER_21: They did.

1054
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,109
SPEAKER_21: You haven't seen any doctors?

1060
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:50,760
SPEAKER_21: No doctors?

1069
01:52:28,369 --> 01:52:30,500
SPEAKER_21: We need an experienced doctor.

1070
01:52:30,569 --> 01:52:33,770
SPEAKER_21: Even if he only stands by, we would relax.

1098
01:55:13,869 --> 01:55:14,930
SPEAKER_21: Just hungry.

1099
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,090
SPEAKER_21: Hasn't been fed for three days!

1100
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:19,069
SPEAKER_21: I'll go buy some buns.

1110
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,899
SPEAKER_21: Of course not. She wasn't born that way.

1112
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:33,680
SPEAKER_21: Erxi's is a work-related injury.
It's not hereditary.

1113
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,779
SPEAKER_21: Anyway, it's bad luck to talk like that.

1114
01:56:38,119 --> 01:56:39,710
SPEAKER_21: Why not use this time...

1115
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,119
SPEAKER_21: to think of a name for the kid?

1118
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,130
SPEAKER_21: - Don't be stupid.
- It was a joke.

1119
01:56:53,630 --> 01:56:55,529
SPEAKER_21: What name do you like?

1121
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,250
SPEAKER_21: You just say anything!

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_21: That's not a name!

1221
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,289
SPEAKER_21: Little Bun...

1222
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:12,920
SPEAKER_21: give me a hand.

1249
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:02,500
SPEAKER_21: everything would've been fine.

1250
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:05,739
SPEAKER_21: He could have saved our Fengxia.

1251
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:08,369
SPEAKER_21: He's a professor, after all.

1254
02:07:16,119 --> 02:07:18,590
SPEAKER_21: We shouldn't have given him water.

1255
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:21,529
SPEAKER_21: People say, once you drink water...

1256
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:24,260
SPEAKER_21: one bun in the stomach turns to seven.

1257
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,289
SPEAKER_21: Dr. Wang ate seven buns.

1258
02:07:27,869 --> 02:07:30,560
SPEAKER_21: Seven times seven is 49.

1259
02:07:31,670 --> 02:07:33,430
SPEAKER_21: It's much too much.

1264
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:50,649
SPEAKER_21: Rice costs more than wheat.

1289
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,130
SPEAKER_21: he'll ride trains and planes...

1290
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:49,840
SPEAKER_21: and life will get better and better.
