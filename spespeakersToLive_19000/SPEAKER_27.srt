98
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,389
SPEAKER_27: Of course.

112
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,370
SPEAKER_27: Don't worry about her.

113
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,580
SPEAKER_27: Get out of my sight!

134
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,649
SPEAKER_27: This can't be happening!

148
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,200
SPEAKER_27: Just settle everything, okay?

149
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:14,399
SPEAKER_27: We'll settle everything then.

292
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,359
SPEAKER_27: It really is booze!

485
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,530
SPEAKER_27: Enough?

486
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,690
SPEAKER_27: Still not enough? Okay, I'll fill it right up.

501
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,420
SPEAKER_27: This is too much.

799
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:00,890
SPEAKER_27: Comrade, could I look at that one?

800
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,619
SPEAKER_27: There's trouble at your home.

801
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:07,390
SPEAKER_27: Red Guards are swarming over the place.

802
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,300
SPEAKER_27: I just caught them on a ladder,
pulling off roof tiles.

804
01:30:12,970 --> 01:30:16,300
SPEAKER_27: No idea! The leader is a cripple.

830
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:12,920
SPEAKER_27: You've gone to so much trouble.

981
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:32,010
SPEAKER_27: You just have to!

982
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,649
SPEAKER_27: We've been through the valley of death.

983
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,949
SPEAKER_27: Coming out alive wasn't easy.

984
01:46:42,390 --> 01:46:43,720
SPEAKER_27: Can't you see?

1148
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,590
SPEAKER_27: Do you hear him?

1149
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:11,329
SPEAKER_27: Are they in there?
