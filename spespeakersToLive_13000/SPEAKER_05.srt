109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,330
SPEAKER_05: Get out!

135
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,950
SPEAKER_05: What are you doing?

137
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,190
SPEAKER_05: Sit down.

138
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,919
SPEAKER_05: - Sit down!
- You planned all this, didn't you?

139
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,000
SPEAKER_05: - Sit.
- Just one more round!

142
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
SPEAKER_05: I'll stake my life.

143
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,480
SPEAKER_05: Don't talk like that.

144
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:00,220
SPEAKER_05: Anyway, your life's worth little now.

272
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,089
SPEAKER_05: This case is in the way!

273
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,049
SPEAKER_05: Whose is it? Get rid of it!

274
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,420
SPEAKER_05: Sir, it's mine.
I've got my things in it. Let me keep it.

276
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,730
SPEAKER_05: It's just a bunch of puppets.
Get rid of them! This is war!

285
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,759
SPEAKER_05: Way to go, Chunsheng!

286
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,170
SPEAKER_05: Take this.

287
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:39,299
SPEAKER_05: - Where'd you get them?
- Off the corpses.

334
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,360
SPEAKER_05: - What are you doing?
- They're shooting!

479
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,829
SPEAKER_05: We won't touch them.

480
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:41,489
SPEAKER_05: We're off to the next house.

496
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,400
SPEAKER_05: How could you?

497
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:15,010
SPEAKER_05: Can't you control this child?

498
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:17,849
SPEAKER_05: What did you think you were doing?

499
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,389
SPEAKER_05: What is this?

502
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,889
SPEAKER_05: - Trying to kill him, or what?
- They're just kids.

503
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:34,460
SPEAKER_05: Kids? Where did he learn that from?

504
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,369
SPEAKER_05: This hasn't anything to do with us adults.

505
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,869
SPEAKER_05: We don't know what's going on.

506
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:44,739
SPEAKER_05: Do you expect me to believe that?

507
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:48,179
SPEAKER_05: It's sabotage.
Sabotage to the communal kitchen.

508
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,280
SPEAKER_05: And sabotage of the Great Leap Forward!

509
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,559
SPEAKER_05: That kid could not dream that up.

510
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,090
SPEAKER_05: Youqing! Look what you've done!

511
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,690
SPEAKER_05: Apologize. Say you were wrong.

512
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,489
SPEAKER_05: Now!

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,530
SPEAKER_05: I'm talking to you.

514
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:14,969
SPEAKER_05: - Are you going?
- No.

515
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:17,269
SPEAKER_05: - Are you going or not?
- No!

516
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,039
SPEAKER_05: - I'm telling you to go!
- No!

571
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:09,940
SPEAKER_05: Daddy.

572
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,710
SPEAKER_05: How do you like my singing?

573
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:38,269
SPEAKER_05: You little bastard! I'll break your legs!

581
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:09,239
SPEAKER_05: with a whole pig stuffed in each one!

582
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:16,380
SPEAKER_05: Eat your fill, and then we'll continue.

583
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,920
SPEAKER_05: Fifteen years, we'll surpass America.

588
01:08:39,409 --> 01:08:42,399
SPEAKER_05: and the last in the toilet!

704
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:16,000
SPEAKER_05: What are you doing, you little wretch?
I'll teach you a lesson!

705
01:21:16,369 --> 01:21:19,130
SPEAKER_05: What are you doing?

706
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,069
SPEAKER_05: How dare you!

707
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,689
SPEAKER_05: What's going on?

708
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,899
SPEAKER_05: She smashed the windows of the jeep.

709
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,470
SPEAKER_05: Who the heck is she?

710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,279
SPEAKER_05: Let her go!

711
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:33,680
SPEAKER_05: Are you mad?

712
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,579
SPEAKER_05: Do you want your jeep?

713
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,210
SPEAKER_05: No!

714
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:07,439
SPEAKER_05: The 1960s

737
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:27,350
SPEAKER_05: You can't keep them. Burn them!

778
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,869
SPEAKER_05: Comrade Wan Erxi.

824
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,850
SPEAKER_05: Erxi painted this.

844
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:54,819
SPEAKER_05: Let's sing a song!

856
01:35:18,869 --> 01:35:20,840
SPEAKER_05: Move aside! Stand still!

857
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:27,369
SPEAKER_05: Hold your little Red Books.

858
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:33,180
SPEAKER_05: Clear a path! Ship sailing through!

1029
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,520
SPEAKER_05: Send her my very best. She's producing
a little revolutionary successor.

1049
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:13,220
SPEAKER_05: Sit down.

1077
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:29,359
SPEAKER_05: How vile can you get?

1145
01:58:59,689 --> 01:59:02,989
SPEAKER_05: Dad! Mom! Has she given birth?

1155
01:59:28,289 --> 01:59:29,720
SPEAKER_05: Is it a boy?

1160
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:43,159
SPEAKER_05: 7.9 pounds is excellent.

1181
02:01:34,449 --> 02:01:36,810
SPEAKER_05: Don't panic. Think of something.

1190
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:08,039
SPEAKER_05: What do you mean?

1191
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,949
SPEAKER_05: He gobbled up seven buns.

1192
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:12,449
SPEAKER_05: He was starving.

1193
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:14,880
SPEAKER_05: But he was okay after the water.
