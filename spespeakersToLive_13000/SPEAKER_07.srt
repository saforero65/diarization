173
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,640
SPEAKER_07: And the debt is hereby settled.

281
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,940
SPEAKER_07: They're freezing.

282
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,410
SPEAKER_07: No one's looking after them?

293
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,730
SPEAKER_07: Was it from some dead officer?

298
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,150
SPEAKER_07: Lao Quan, the place is deserted.

299
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,119
SPEAKER_07: I'm still dizzy from drinking!

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,589
SPEAKER_07: They've all run off.

302
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,130
SPEAKER_07: How could that be?

303
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,960
SPEAKER_07: The Reds must be on the attack.

309
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,809
SPEAKER_07: Run now...

310
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,380
SPEAKER_07: and you'll be shot.

311
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,550
SPEAKER_07: Better to wait and become a POW.

314
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,719
SPEAKER_07: That's right.

315
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,389
SPEAKER_07: You want to go home, don't run.

318
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,530
SPEAKER_07: How?

320
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,510
SPEAKER_07: Don't reach for your waist!

321
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,570
SPEAKER_07: Do that and you're dead.

322
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,650
SPEAKER_07: The Reds treat POWs well.
I've been one before.

323
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:04,889
SPEAKER_07: Just put those hands up.

331
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,849
SPEAKER_07: Where did you find this coat?

333
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,820
SPEAKER_07: The coat's from my brother's unit.

460
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,280
SPEAKER_07: There'll be meat, fish.

461
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:25,760
SPEAKER_07: Nothing else to contribute?

462
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:27,920
SPEAKER_07: Yes, there is!

463
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,690
SPEAKER_07: But that's wood.

575
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,690
SPEAKER_07: We've smelted our steel...

576
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,989
SPEAKER_07: and reached our production target.

577
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:54,500
SPEAKER_07: We're off to report the good news.

594
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:49,439
SPEAKER_07: What's up?

764
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,449
SPEAKER_07: Comrade Wan Erxi's here.

862
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,579
SPEAKER_07: First, pay respects to Chairman Mao.
