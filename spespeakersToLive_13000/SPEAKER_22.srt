43
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,319
SPEAKER_22: Take care, Master.

44
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:07,350
SPEAKER_22: Welcome home, sir.

45
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,620
SPEAKER_22: Dad!

46
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,660
SPEAKER_22: Degenerate! Another night gambling!

127
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,590
SPEAKER_22: But I sure like that mansion of yours.

128
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,230
SPEAKER_22: See you there in a few days.

129
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,669
SPEAKER_22: You can't just win and walk away.

245
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,910
SPEAKER_22: They are fabulous.

246
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,250
SPEAKER_22: My heart is full of sorrow

631
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:08,670
SPEAKER_22: It's Fugui's son?

632
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,649
SPEAKER_22: District Chief arrived after dark.

633
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,079
SPEAKER_22: He backed up,
and his jeep knocked the wall down.

634
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:19,020
SPEAKER_22: Youqing was sleeping on the other side.

635
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,850
SPEAKER_22: When the wall collapsed...

636
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,159
SPEAKER_22: he didn't have a chance.

637
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:26,560
SPEAKER_22: The District Chief was hurt, too.

638
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,130
SPEAKER_22: He hadn't slept for three days.

639
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:58,420
SPEAKER_22: Fugui, listen to me.

640
01:13:58,489 --> 01:14:02,430
SPEAKER_22: We have to try and bear it,
even in the worst of times.

831
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:14,779
SPEAKER_22: Please come again.

832
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:25,489
SPEAKER_22: What do you think about Fengxia and me?

919
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:53,890
SPEAKER_22: That she's in terrific shape.

954
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,039
SPEAKER_22: Chunsheng.

1033
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,300
SPEAKER_22: From the contractions, not right now.

1034
01:50:21,369 --> 01:50:23,710
SPEAKER_22: Fengxia, don't be nervous.

1058
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,550
SPEAKER_22: They've been locked away.

1059
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:48,020
SPEAKER_22: The Red Guards are in control!

1062
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:02,159
SPEAKER_22: Yes, us!

1063
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:03,399
SPEAKER_22: I mean, older ones.

1071
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,239
SPEAKER_22: Have to get one out.

1072
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,710
SPEAKER_22: Let me think.

1076
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,359
SPEAKER_22: me and my wife,
saying she wasn't fit to reproduce.

1150
01:59:11,869 --> 01:59:13,460
SPEAKER_22: - Have a look.
- Not yet!

1151
01:59:13,539 --> 01:59:15,529
SPEAKER_22: Please, I'm the father!

1156
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:32,279
SPEAKER_22: Yes, 7.9 pounds!

1157
01:59:32,659 --> 01:59:35,289
SPEAKER_22: - How is he?
- They're both fine!

1166
02:00:00,789 --> 02:00:02,380
SPEAKER_22: What's with him?

1167
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:13,390
SPEAKER_22: He ate too quickly.
