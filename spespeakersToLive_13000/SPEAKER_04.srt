80
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,459
SPEAKER_04: Please.

81
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,689
SPEAKER_04: I'm not asking much.

82
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,470
SPEAKER_04: Only to live a quiet life together.

83
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,700
SPEAKER_04: Fugui, you choose. Gambling or family?

84
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,509
SPEAKER_04: Tell me.

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,659
SPEAKER_04: My luck's changed.

103
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,980
SPEAKER_04: Fugui, for the last time.

104
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,919
SPEAKER_04: Come home.

118
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,690
SPEAKER_04: You've lost everything.

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,429
SPEAKER_04: What do you mean?

198
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,789
SPEAKER_04: "Don't Gamble."

199
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:27,730
SPEAKER_04: He'll never gamble.

200
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,329
SPEAKER_04: Who chose that name?

201
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,759
SPEAKER_04: Me.

202
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,509
SPEAKER_04: Very good, very good.

205
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:45,450
SPEAKER_04: Is his name really "Don't Gamble"?

208
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,160
SPEAKER_04: Jiazhen, it's great to have you back.

211
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,680
SPEAKER_04: Let's put the past behind us...

212
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,009
SPEAKER_04: and live peacefully.

222
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,420
SPEAKER_04: Life won't be easy.

223
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:53,579
SPEAKER_04: Don't say that.

268
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:43,619
SPEAKER_04: I'd die happy if I could drive.

316
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,170
SPEAKER_04: They won't shoot us?

317
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,400
SPEAKER_04: Not as long as you've got your hands up.

324
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,940
SPEAKER_04: - The attack hasn't started.
- Let's put them down.

352
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,920
SPEAKER_04: She never shut her eyes...

353
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,849
SPEAKER_04: kept them fixed on the door,
so sure you'd be back.

354
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,570
SPEAKER_04: You should have written.

361
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,659
SPEAKER_04: and gave me this job, delivering water.

362
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,489
SPEAKER_04: I'm up before dawn.

363
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,929
SPEAKER_04: Everyone wants water.

364
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,519
SPEAKER_04: The more I deliver, the more I earn.

365
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,789
SPEAKER_04: It's been hard on the kids.

366
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,199
SPEAKER_04: They never get...

367
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,869
SPEAKER_04: a good night's sleep.

371
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,449
SPEAKER_04: In fact, she was lucky.

372
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:07,019
SPEAKER_04: For a week, she ran a high fever.

373
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,260
SPEAKER_04: No one thought she'd pull through.

380
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:59,210
SPEAKER_04: - I heard you got back this morning.
- I'm back.

381
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,199
SPEAKER_04: I have come to see if you need anything.

382
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:04,070
SPEAKER_04: Look at this.

383
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,119
SPEAKER_04: He has served in the Liberation Army?

386
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,789
SPEAKER_04: That's taking part.

387
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,289
SPEAKER_04: You were with Chunsheng.
Why isn't he back?

391
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,110
SPEAKER_04: to attend Long'er's public trial.

392
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,579
SPEAKER_04: Come along and get an education.

393
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:42,210
SPEAKER_04: What did Long'er do?

395
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,030
SPEAKER_04: But it's not just that.

396
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:55,820
SPEAKER_04: The government wanted part of the house.

397
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,699
SPEAKER_04: He refused, beat up a cadre...

398
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,599
SPEAKER_04: and then set fire to the place.

399
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,769
SPEAKER_04: Classic counterrevolutionary sabotage.

401
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,909
SPEAKER_04: It burnt for days.

402
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:17,179
SPEAKER_04: Your timber was first class!

403
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,960
SPEAKER_04: That wasn't ours.
It was counterrevolutionary timber.

427
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,730
SPEAKER_04: Not landlords.

428
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,070
SPEAKER_04: Ordinary townspeople.

432
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,059
SPEAKER_04: Better dry it out fast.

433
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:18,699
SPEAKER_04: Have to keep it safe.

434
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:24,530
SPEAKER_04: Are you sure we're just townsfolk?

435
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,800
SPEAKER_04: Of course.

436
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,969
SPEAKER_04: Poor townspeople.

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,400
SPEAKER_04: It's good to be poor. Nothing like it.

438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,579
SPEAKER_04: Get a frame for it tomorrow.

439
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,050
SPEAKER_04: I'll hang it on the wall.

440
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:40,719
SPEAKER_04: Good idea!

449
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:49,050
SPEAKER_04: It's ready.

450
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,409
SPEAKER_04: It's all here?

451
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,760
SPEAKER_04: Keep these.

452
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,619
SPEAKER_04: To deliver water to the steelworks.

453
00:52:56,699 --> 00:52:58,429
SPEAKER_04: Everyone will be thirsty.

454
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,130
SPEAKER_04: We'll take these.

456
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,969
SPEAKER_04: We're racing towards Communism,
and you worry about food?

457
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,000
SPEAKER_04: We are setting up communal kitchens.

458
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:16,280
SPEAKER_04: When you're hungry...

459
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:19,119
SPEAKER_04: just come to the canteen.

467
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:49,670
SPEAKER_04: We are less politically aware than your son.

468
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,079
SPEAKER_04: It's enough for two bullets.

469
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,849
SPEAKER_04: We are just two bullets short
of liberating Taiwan.

470
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,030
SPEAKER_04: So let's get that metal.

475
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,179
SPEAKER_04: I see your point.

476
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,519
SPEAKER_04: All I've seen at the worksites
are student marching bands.

477
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:32,280
SPEAKER_04: We'll spur them on with puppet shows.

478
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,949
SPEAKER_04: You can leave those.

482
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:50,269
SPEAKER_04: Sure we are. We'll definitely liberate Taiwan.

523
00:59:46,769 --> 00:59:49,469
SPEAKER_04: That guy's word is law? The government?

524
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,239
SPEAKER_04: I tried to stop you.

529
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:03,710
SPEAKER_04: How so?

530
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,130
SPEAKER_04: Can't you see I'm doing this for our family?

535
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,480
SPEAKER_04: Isn't he your own flesh and blood?

536
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:33,610
SPEAKER_04: You, looking after us! After all these years.

557
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,500
SPEAKER_04: Well?

558
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,300
SPEAKER_04: I'm not going!

559
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,750
SPEAKER_04: Do you like hearing daddy sing?

560
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,110
SPEAKER_04: Mommy doesn't either. He's so smug.

561
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,409
SPEAKER_04: Let's play a practical joke on him.

562
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:15,599
SPEAKER_04: Take him tea full of vinegar.

578
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:57,219
SPEAKER_04: Everyone's earned merit.

579
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,969
SPEAKER_04: Fugui, Jiazhen,
you've made a real contribution.

580
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,670
SPEAKER_04: There'll be dumplings
at the canteen tonight...

584
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,500
SPEAKER_04: We've made enough steel
for three cannon balls.

585
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,590
SPEAKER_04: They'll all go to Taiwan!

586
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
SPEAKER_04: One to land on Chiang Kai-shek's bed...

587
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,340
SPEAKER_04: another on his dinner table...

589
01:08:44,449 --> 01:08:47,880
SPEAKER_04: He won't be able to sleep or eat
or ever take a dump...

592
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:08,970
SPEAKER_04: Let them sleep. They'll eat later.

599
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,920
SPEAKER_04: He's not going anywhere.
He hasn't slept in days.

600
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,390
SPEAKER_04: Leave him alone.

601
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,899
SPEAKER_04: - The District Chief is coming.
- So?

602
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,760
SPEAKER_04: A kid still has to sleep.

611
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,670
SPEAKER_04: Are 15 dumplings enough?

612
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,239
SPEAKER_04: Have 20. You should eat more.

652
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,880
SPEAKER_04: That should be enough.

667
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,210
SPEAKER_04: The District Chief has come.

671
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,670
SPEAKER_04: - He's already here.
- Tell him to go.

674
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:03,930
SPEAKER_04: after I settled in.

677
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,039
SPEAKER_04: You're the District Chief?

681
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,729
SPEAKER_04: And you killed him!

683
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:47,600
SPEAKER_04: Don't be like that.

684
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:50,239
SPEAKER_04: The District Chief is upset, too.

685
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,779
SPEAKER_04: How can I ever make it up?

697
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,779
SPEAKER_04: District Chief, let's go.

698
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:40,920
SPEAKER_04: I think you should go, Chief.

722
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,670
SPEAKER_04: Everyone knows about them.

727
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,619
SPEAKER_04: Don't you see what they are?

728
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:21,590
SPEAKER_04: Emperors, scholars and beauties.

729
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,550
SPEAKER_04: Classic feudal types.

730
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,119
SPEAKER_04: Latest editorial:

731
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,760
SPEAKER_04: "The older, the more reactionary."

732
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:41,739
SPEAKER_04: Do as Chairman Mao says.

736
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,880
SPEAKER_04: Fetch a brazier.

738
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,609
SPEAKER_04: Fugui...

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,010
SPEAKER_04: Chunsheng has asked me many times...

740
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:59,119
SPEAKER_04: to get you a better job. What do you think?

745
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,390
SPEAKER_04: I'll tell you about him.

746
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:19,100
SPEAKER_04: Let's not let her in on it for now.

747
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:26,649
SPEAKER_04: I've found just the man for her.

749
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:34,750
SPEAKER_04: He works in a factory in the county seat.

750
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:38,920
SPEAKER_04: He is the leader of the factory's Red Guards.

751
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,789
SPEAKER_04: He'd like to meet her.

755
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,329
SPEAKER_04: How lame? Can he walk?

756
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:55,300
SPEAKER_04: Yes, and run if he has to.

758
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:00,949
SPEAKER_04: Was he born a cripple?

759
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:03,310
SPEAKER_04: No, it was an accident at work.

760
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:05,979
SPEAKER_04: He gets compensation.

765
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,420
SPEAKER_04: Comrade Wan Erxi.

766
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,989
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's mom and dad.

770
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,289
SPEAKER_04: Comrade Wan works
at the East Wind Factory.

771
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,689
SPEAKER_04: His father and grandfather
were workers, too.

772
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:17,020
SPEAKER_04: Solid working class stock.

773
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,890
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's father took part in the revolution.

777
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,510
SPEAKER_04: Where's Fengxia?

779
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:03,300
SPEAKER_04: Comrade Fengxia.

783
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,520
SPEAKER_04: You won't stay?

784
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:31,029
SPEAKER_04: Have some lunch first.

785
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,729
SPEAKER_04: No, really.

791
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,760
SPEAKER_04: He only glanced at her, and wouldn't stay.

792
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:06,430
SPEAKER_04: If it doesn't work out, we'll keep looking.

793
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,659
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, it's up to Fengxia.

806
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,569
SPEAKER_04: A cripple?

807
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:21,539
SPEAKER_04: Must be Wan Erxi!

808
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:25,310
SPEAKER_04: He doesn't like Fengxia,
so he tears the place down.

826
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,659
SPEAKER_04: Erxi is good with his hands.

827
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:56,930
SPEAKER_04: He painted all the Chairman Maos
in our factory!

833
01:32:26,369 --> 01:32:28,340
SPEAKER_04: We're happy if you are.

834
01:32:28,569 --> 01:32:29,939
SPEAKER_04: We approve.

835
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,829
SPEAKER_04: Shall we set a date?

836
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:35,939
SPEAKER_04: Anytime. You decide.

837
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:40,340
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's had a hard life.

838
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:43,109
SPEAKER_04: If you don't mind...

839
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:46,010
SPEAKER_04: let's make the wedding a real occasion.

841
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,399
SPEAKER_04: Today comrades, Wan Erxi and Xu Fengxia...

842
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:48,779
SPEAKER_04: begin their wedded life.

843
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:52,720
SPEAKER_04: In good times, we think of Chairman Mao.

880
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,649
SPEAKER_04: Water's not boiled.

888
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,350
SPEAKER_04: If only Youqing had been here today.

889
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:03,260
SPEAKER_04: I'll be going.

894
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:36,130
SPEAKER_04: Give it back to him.

895
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,630
SPEAKER_04: I don't want his gifts.

896
01:39:38,729 --> 01:39:40,699
SPEAKER_04: But it's Chairman Mao.

920
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,000
SPEAKER_04: Still, you can't be too careful.

921
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:58,829
SPEAKER_04: Your folks aren't around.

922
01:41:58,909 --> 01:42:02,069
SPEAKER_04: After the birth,
you'll stay with us for a while.

923
01:42:04,909 --> 01:42:07,609
SPEAKER_04: Spend as much time as you can with her.

924
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:11,149
SPEAKER_04: When I was pregnant with Fengxia...

925
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,449
SPEAKER_04: her dad was never around.

937
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,529
SPEAKER_04: After the child is born...

938
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:04,399
SPEAKER_04: have a photo taken every year.

939
01:43:05,710 --> 01:43:08,369
SPEAKER_04: We've no photos of Fengxia as a child.

943
01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:24,050
SPEAKER_04: Dad, I saw Chunsheng yesterday.

953
01:44:15,539 --> 01:44:16,640
SPEAKER_04: Who?

967
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,060
SPEAKER_04: All my debts will have been paid.

968
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,220
SPEAKER_04: What do you mean?

1002
01:48:19,689 --> 01:48:21,649
SPEAKER_04: What are these eggs for?

1004
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:27,720
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's about to give birth?

1008
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:38,560
SPEAKER_04: Another working class member on the way!

1013
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,289
SPEAKER_04: Why's she crying?

1014
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,960
SPEAKER_04: What's happened?

1015
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:09,329
SPEAKER_04: I'm no longer head of the township.

1016
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:12,859
SPEAKER_04: They say I'm a capitalist.

1017
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,439
SPEAKER_04: I have to confess my crimes.

1021
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,479
SPEAKER_04: I have faith in the Party.

1022
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,479
SPEAKER_04: I've always followed Chairman Mao's path.

1024
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:38,130
SPEAKER_04: Let's not talk about it.

1025
01:49:38,199 --> 01:49:39,859
SPEAKER_04: You go to Fengxia.

1026
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,060
SPEAKER_04: Go now, I'll be okay.

1030
01:50:05,989 --> 01:50:08,390
SPEAKER_04: Everything's fine and normal.

1050
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:26,840
SPEAKER_04: They're all so young.

1051
01:51:27,369 --> 01:51:29,000
SPEAKER_04: Are they nurses?

1057
01:51:39,489 --> 01:51:41,579
SPEAKER_04: We must find a good doctor.

1066
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,359
SPEAKER_04: Erxi, I'm worried.

1067
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:24,899
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's a mute.

1068
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,300
SPEAKER_04: Can these young people cope?

1081
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:42,909
SPEAKER_04: To show him the heirs
of this new, Red world.

1085
01:53:49,579 --> 01:53:51,909
SPEAKER_04: I wouldn't dare.

1106
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,069
SPEAKER_04: Give them to Dr. Wang.

1109
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:24,060
SPEAKER_04: Fengxia's child won't be mute, will he?

1111
01:56:27,869 --> 01:56:29,899
SPEAKER_04: Will the baby be crippled?

1116
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:46,390
SPEAKER_04: What name do you like?

1117
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:50,729
SPEAKER_04: "Don't Gamble."

1120
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:08,949
SPEAKER_04: "Little Bun."

1122
01:57:11,550 --> 01:57:13,250
SPEAKER_04: That's not a name!

1123
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,350
SPEAKER_04: But it's a tradition.

1124
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,949
SPEAKER_04: Cat, Dog or Little Bun...

1125
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,020
SPEAKER_04: are not recorded in the Register of Names.

1126
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:24,189
SPEAKER_04: He'd know for sure.

1127
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,789
SPEAKER_04: He doesn't know those kids exist...

1128
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:30,000
SPEAKER_04: so they don't die.

1129
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:32,829
SPEAKER_04: That's what the old folks say.

1130
01:57:35,579 --> 01:57:37,739
SPEAKER_04: Okay, then Little Bun it is.

1131
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:40,109
SPEAKER_04: For now, anyway.

1132
01:57:41,149 --> 01:57:44,409
SPEAKER_04: Later, his dad can give him a proper name.

1140
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,680
SPEAKER_04: Absolutely.

1141
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,489
SPEAKER_04: Can we see them?

1164
01:59:53,949 --> 01:59:57,439
SPEAKER_04: Erxi, seeing as they are both fine...

1165
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,850
SPEAKER_04: why don't you see Dr. Wang back.

1174
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,579
SPEAKER_04: Some water should help.

1227
02:05:28,979 --> 02:05:30,510
SPEAKER_04: to show her.

1228
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,149
SPEAKER_04: He's another year older.

1229
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:35,409
SPEAKER_04: Fine, I'll let Erxi know.

1230
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:46,060
SPEAKER_04: Little Bun! Hold onto those chicks.

1245
02:06:46,359 --> 02:06:48,619
SPEAKER_04: Before you were born...

1246
02:06:49,729 --> 02:06:51,890
SPEAKER_04: Granny said to mommy that...

1247
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:55,069
SPEAKER_04: she should take a photo every year.

1248
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,729
SPEAKER_04: If I hadn't given Dr. Wang those buns...

1270
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,890
SPEAKER_04: Let's see.

1287
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,829
SPEAKER_04: You will ride on an ox's back.

1288
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:43,729
SPEAKER_04: Little Bun won't ride on an ox...
