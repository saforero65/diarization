01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,699
SPEAKER_17: Youqing's not going to any stupid show.

548
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,909

SPEAKER_17: Jiazhen, where's Youqing?

687
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,520

SPEAKER_17: I'll look after her.

891
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:07,270
SPEAKER_17: Never mind.

892
01:39:09,939 --> 01:39:12,739
SPEAKER_17: Jiazhen, I know you don't want to see me.

893
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,800
SPEAKER_17: I'll leave my gift here and be gone.

906

SPEAKER_17: I had the photo framed.

1061
01:51:58,310 --> 01:52:01,100
SPEAKER_17: Comrade, are there any doctors?

1088
01:54:15,010 --> 01:54:17,029
SPEAKER_17: Dr. Wang, don't be afraid.

1089
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:19,439
SPEAKER_17: I was putting on a show.

1090
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:21,699
SPEAKER_17: We're not accusing you.

1091
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:23,770
SPEAKER_17: My wife's having a baby.

1092
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,350

on the way home.

1232

SPEAKER_17: Now we've got to carry them!

1233
02:05:53,369 --> 02:05:55,399
SPEAKER_17: Careful! Don't drop them!

1234
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:57,770
SPEAKER_17: Are you happy?

1266
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:16,979
SPEAKER_17: - I'll make dinner.
