18
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:55,730
SPEAKER_10: You've lost again.

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,000
SPEAKER_10: Not one lucky toss all night.

36
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:11,100
SPEAKER_10: Long'er, you're nearly there.

37
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,800
SPEAKER_10: One more night like this...

38
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:19,209
SPEAKER_10: you'll have him right where you want him.

39
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,100
SPEAKER_10: Sure there's no mistake?

40
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,579
SPEAKER_10: Look at the records.

41
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,220
SPEAKER_10: Master Fugui is going home. You take him.

85
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:01,759
SPEAKER_10: Your win, Master Fugui.

88
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,080
SPEAKER_10: Master Fugui, your wife's here.

89
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,059
SPEAKER_10: What are you doing here?

90
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,250
SPEAKER_10: Well?

91
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:48,870
SPEAKER_10: Mr. Long'er says
if you're busy he'll take a rain check.

99
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,909
SPEAKER_10: Master Fugui, you lost.

100
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,590
SPEAKER_10: Let's roll!

116
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,649
SPEAKER_10: Well?

117
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,360
SPEAKER_10: Master Fugui, you're out of the game.

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
SPEAKER_10: You bet your property.
It's equal to what you owe Long'er.

121
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,110
SPEAKER_10: You don't have a roof tile to your name.

122
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,090
SPEAKER_10: What is it?

123
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,620
SPEAKER_10: Master Fugui must settle his account.

405
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,429
SPEAKER_10: Of course. You're you, he's him.

672
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,609
SPEAKER_10: It's me, Chunsheng.

734
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,500
SPEAKER_10: Let's not bring up the past.

735
01:24:09,939 --> 01:24:12,930
SPEAKER_10: Burn them, okay?
I've got other people to see.

744
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,729
SPEAKER_10: I may have found a prospect for Fengxia.

776
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:38,909
SPEAKER_10: Good.

873
01:37:43,579 --> 01:37:45,880
SPEAKER_10: Congratulations on Fengxia's wedding.

874
01:37:46,289 --> 01:37:48,760
SPEAKER_10: - When did you get here?
- A while ago.

940
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:09,569
SPEAKER_10: Okay.

941
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:13,109
SPEAKER_10: Fengxia, after the child is born...

955
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:24,779
SPEAKER_10: What do you want?

956
01:44:26,949 --> 01:44:28,850
SPEAKER_10: Come out for a second.
